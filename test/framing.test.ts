/**
 * Framing parity: does each command's default view answer the page's question?
 *
 * `docs/PARITY.md` §1 counts six user-reported CLI defects and finds that
 * **four of the six produced correct numbers**. The sort key was executions vs
 * job runs — same set, wrong order. `issues` listed individual tests while
 * `issues.html` leads with Bugzilla components ranked by issue count — right
 * numbers, wrong question. `--coverage` printed 453 never-scheduled configs —
 * correct data, useless framing. A harness that diffs values alone catches a
 * third of what has actually gone wrong here.
 *
 * So this file asserts the third class §1 names and §5 specifies: **framing**.
 * For each command with a corresponding dashboard page, what one row is, how
 * rows are grouped, what key they are ranked on and in which direction, what
 * time window is covered, what is filtered in or out, and which harness is
 * read — asserted against the CLI, and stated side by side with what the page
 * does.
 *
 * ## Why both sides are recorded, and what a divergence means
 *
 * Every entry carries a `page` block and a `cli` block. The point is **not** to
 * freeze current CLI behaviour: a table that only restated the CLI would agree
 * with any bug the CLI already has, which is precisely how `issues` shipped a
 * flat test list through a green suite. Recording the page separately is what
 * makes "the CLI answers a different question" a thing the file can express.
 *
 * A field where the two differ must be listed in that entry's `divergences`,
 * with a reason. An undeclared divergence fails. A declared divergence whose
 * two sides have stopped differing also fails — otherwise the allow-list
 * becomes where regressions hide, which is the discipline `PARITY.md` §4 sets
 * for the page-vs-page comparison and §5 reuses here.
 *
 * ## What the assertions run against
 *
 * Real command output, through `run()` with the checked-in fixtures, not the
 * constants the commands read. An assertion that imports `DEFAULT_TYPES` and
 * checks the CLI uses `DEFAULT_TYPES` is worth nothing — it passes whatever the
 * constant says. So the expectations below are literals, and they are compared
 * against parsed `--json` from an actual invocation.
 *
 * Two fields cannot be reached that way and are marked `assertedFrom:
 * 'source'`, with the reason on the entry: they name a behaviour that no
 * fixture exercises. They are still in the table, because the table's other job
 * is to be the written-down acceptance criteria for the migrations `PARITY.md`
 * §6 sequences after this.
 *
 * ## Out of scope, deliberately
 *
 * `guide`, `dates`, `cache` and the hang mode of `crash` have no page
 * (`PARITY.md` §7). `UNCOVERED_COMMANDS` names them so "not in the table" is a
 * recorded decision rather than an oversight, and a new command that lands
 * without a framing entry fails the completeness check at the bottom.
