/**
 * The query layer, against the checked-in fixtures.
 *
 * Golden values are written as literals and were derived from the fixtures
 * rather than from the code under test — every one of them is re-derivable by
 * summing the raw JSON, and several are cross-checked against a second,
 * independent path in the assertions below.
 *
 * The four things these tests are really defending:
 *
 * 1. **Reconciliation.** A test's per-config run counts must sum to its total
 *    run count. The two are computed by different code over different shapes
 *    (`durations` groups carry a job name, `task-ids` groups need a `taskInfo`
 *    hop), so agreeing is evidence rather than tautology.
 * 2. **The family asymmetry.** A skip count means a different thing per family
 *    (`FORMATS.md`), and the fixtures reproduce it exactly: 2,147 `run-if`
 *    skips in the daily file, zero in every aggregate. A regression that
 *    applied the filter in the wrong place would move one of those numbers.
 * 3. **The coverage states.** ran-and-passed and ran-and-skipped are what
 *    `--coverage` exists to separate — both are recorded facts, and a
 *    failure-only view shows neither. The test asserts a real test that has
 *    both. Configs the test was *not* scheduled on are deliberately absent:
 *    see `lib/query/coverage.ts`.
 * 4. **The recent window's exact width.** Sized by run count rather than by
 *    days, and inclusive at both ends. An off-by-one there reports an 11-day
 *    window as 10 days — a plausible-looking wrong number, which is the
 *    failure mode this data keeps producing.
 *
 * Where a branch is reachable by the format but absent from today's data —
 * an `EXPECTED-FAIL` carrying a message, a config with both a `skip-if` and a
 * `run-if`, a day on which CI did not run — the input is built by hand and
 * says so. Those are the cases a fixture cannot supply and a mutation would
 * otherwise survive.
