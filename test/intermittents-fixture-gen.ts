/**
 * Records `test/fixtures/intermittents-trunk-2026-08-10.json` from live
 * Treeherder and Bugzilla.
 *
 * A generator rather than a hand-written fixture: the shapes are someone else's,
 * and a fixture invented from the serializer source would agree with what the
 * code expects rather than with what the API sends. The `{"bug_id": null}` group
 * and a summary naming a path that is not a test are both things nobody would
 * have thought to write.
 *
 * The head of the ranking is not a representative sample — every summary in it
 * happens to name a real test — so `ALWAYS_RECORD` pins the bugs that carry the
 * cases classification can get wrong. A fixture that cannot express a failure
 * cannot pin the fix for it.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   node --experimental-strip-types test/intermittents-fixture-gen.ts
