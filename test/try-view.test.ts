/**
 * `try.html`'s view model, against a real pinned try push.
 *
 * ## Why this imports from `site/`
 *
 * `site/try-view.ts` is **page-local** — it names badge classes, count-cell
 * thresholds and tooltip prose, so it is the page's, not `lib/`'s. A node test
 * importing it is the point: the seam is the module boundary, not the directory.
 *
 * The import also enforces the DOM-free rule for free. The root tsconfig
 * compiles `test/**` and has **no DOM lib**, so a `document` reach from the view
 * model is a compile error here even though `tsconfig.site.json` would accept it.
 *
 * ## The fixture, and why it is what it is
 *
 * `test/fixtures/try-7d16bff81bb1.json` is try push 7d16bff81bb1, captured
 * once. Its `timings` were produced by running **the page's own profile-worker
 * source** over the 39 parseable profiles of that push's 46 failed test jobs
 * (7 were unreadable, and are recorded as such by their absence — which is
 * itself part of what `notAnalyzed` counts). Its `jobs` is the complete
 * Treeherder job list, 1,731 entries, so `jobRunCounts` is the real one.
 *
 * It is real data through the real parser, which matters for the trap this
 * project has now hit three times: **a test that feeds in the value under test
 * pins a bug as correct.** Nothing below passes a `passRate`, a `failRate` or a
 * count as a literal argument to the function that computes it. Where an
 * expected value is a literal, it was read off the fixture by a path that does
 * not go through `site/try-view.ts` — the helpers at the top of this file — and
 * the reasoning that fixes it is stated.
 *
 * ## What is not tested here
 *
 * The rendering. `site/try.ts` turns these structures into elements and nothing
 * else; asserting on that in node needs a DOM shim that is a second
 * implementation of the browser. It is verified where it runs: both pages loaded
 * in Chrome against one pinned snapshot and compared node for node
 * (`PARITY.md` §4).
