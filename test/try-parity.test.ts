/**
 * New page vs CLI for `try`: `site/try.html?rev=…` ↔ `fx-tests try <rev>`.
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §5, and the sequencing step §6.4 asks for "per page, as each
 * lands". Both sides are driven over the **same pinned push**
 * (`test/fixtures/try-7d16bff81bb1.json`) and compared on the three classes
 * §1 names: values, order, framing.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `test/framing.test.ts`
 *
 * That file asserts **CLI vs the old page**, and its page column is a *source
 * audit* — facts read off `try.html` with a `file:line` citation each. It
 * cannot execute the page, so it can say "`old/try.html:1749` sorts on
 * `instances.length`" but not "the two produce the same 26 rows in the same
 * order".
 *
 * This file complements it rather than extending it, and the reason is that
 * they cannot share a table: framing.test.ts's page side is *read*, this one's
 * is *run*. Merging them would put a literal transcribed from a line number
 * next to a value computed at test time and give the reader no way to tell
 * which kind of claim a failure was. The two do overlap deliberately in one
 * place — the tie-break divergence is declared in both — because it is the one
 * that has to stay declared no matter which side is compared.
 *
 * ## What each side is
 *
 * - **Page**: `site/try-view.ts`'s `aggregateFailures` / `sortTests` /
 *   `splitTables`, driven exactly as `site/try.ts` drives them. Same setup as
 *   `test/try-view.test.ts`, which is why that file's helpers are followed
 *   rather than re-derived.
 * - **CLI**: a real `run()` invocation with a fake Treeherder client and
 *   synthesized profiles (`test/parity-harness.ts`). Offline, no browser.
 *
 * The synthesis is the one construction worth being suspicious of, so it is
 * checked before anything is claimed from it: the first test below re-parses
 * every synthesized profile through the CLI's own `parseTestMarkers` and
 * compares the result to the fixture's timings field by field. 178 of the
 * push's 180 timings come back identical, and the two that do not are the two
 * divergences declared at the bottom of this file.

 * both sides call one function proves only that the function was called twice.

 * 1,584 are the **right** numbers. Both are literals read off the fixture's job
 * list, and the CLI's side of each is `profilesRead` from a real `run()` — a
 * count of artifacts a display filter cannot change, taken at the far end of
 * the command from the selection. Between `selectTryJobs` and that number sit

 * the widening; `cde2ebd` records a mutation where exactly one of them did.

 * Blob, so it cannot import `lib/model/failure-message.ts` and has to carry a
 * copy of `normalizeMessage`. A copy is exactly the thing that produced the
 * divergence in the first place — upstream's two call sites disagreed about
 * CRLF for as long as the page existed — so the copy is pinned here against
 * the shared function on inputs chosen to separate them.
 *
 * The worker's source is read out of `site/try.ts` and evaluated, rather than
 * reimplemented in this file. Reimplementing it would be the defect this
 * repository names as dominant: the expected value would derive from a

 * constant, so both *classify* one as a failure. Only the page could ever
 * *produce* one: `data.expected` appeared zero times in `cli/commands/try.ts`,
 * so a now-wrong `fail-if` annotation was a row on `try.html` and invisible in
 * `fx-tests try`. Matching constants, different universes — the same shape as
 * the `--all-jobs` defect, and made worse by the hoist, because a shared
 * constant looks authoritative while one consumer cannot reach one of its
 * values.
 *
 * ## Why the CLI derives it rather than the constant being unshared
 *
 * The alternative was to stop sharing `FAILURE_STATUSES`. Rejected: the two
 * sides genuinely answer the same question ("is this a row in the failures
 * table"), and the set differing between them is what the hoist existed to
 * prevent. The gap was in the *producer*, not the classifier, so the producer
 * is what was fixed.
 *
 * ## What the corpus says, and why the test is synthetic anyway
 *
 * Measured over the 972 cached profiles of push 7d16bff81bb1: 371 parsed,
 * 135,712 `Test` markers, and **zero** carrying an `expected` field — the only
 * keys present are `color, message, name, status, test, type`. So this status
 * is unreachable on both sides for this push, and no fixture can exercise it.
 * That is a reason to synthesize the marker, not a reason to skip it: the
 * annotation is real, the page has always handled it, and an untested branch
 * on one side is how the two drifted.

// --- item 18's count, which is the whole feature -------------------------

/**
 * ## Why an arithmetic test, on rendered text
 *
 * Item 18's default row says how many messages it is not showing. That number is
 * the feature — it is what tells a reader to pass `--messages` — so a wrong one
 * defeats it silently, and review found two ways it was wrong.
 *
 * `messages` and `allMessages` are **not nested**, which is the trap:
 *
 * - a synthetic `CRASH` row has its signature in `messages` and nothing at all in
 *   `allMessages` (a crash marker carries no `TestStatus` messages), so
 *   `allMessages.length - shown.length` went *negative* and the hint vanished;
 * - a message carried on the `Test` marker rather than a `TestStatus` one is
 *   likewise in `messages` only, so it was subtracted from a total that never
 *   counted it.
 *
 * Asserted on the rendered lines rather than on the JSON, because the defect was
 * in the renderer and the JSON was right both times.
