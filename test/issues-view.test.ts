/**
 * `next/issues-view.ts` — the view model behind the migrated issues page.
 *
 * ## Where the expected values come from
 *
 * **Not from the thing under test.** This project has had *eight* occurrences
 * of a test whose expectation was produced by the code it was checking; one
 * shipped a visibly wrong digit, two pinned bugs as correct, and one was inside
 * the file written to prevent them.
 *
 * So the numbers below are tallied **by hand off the raw fixture arrays** —
 * `testRuns[t][s].counts`, summed against `tables.statuses` — with no call into
 * `lib/query/issues.ts` or `next/issues-view.ts`. `TALLY` is that hand count,
 * written out as literals, and `handTally()` re-derives it from the file so
 * that a fixture swap fails loudly instead of silently comparing a stale
 * constant. The two are asserted equal before anything else runs.
 *
 * For each assertion the question asked was: **what wrong implementation still
 * passes this?** Where the answer was "a plausible one", the test was changed
 * — the search tests assert what *disappears* as well as what survives,
 * because an earlier test in this repo asserted a filter "keeps rows whole"
 * while never checking that non-matching rows go away, and the filter could
 * have been deleted with every test still green.
 *
 * ## Mutation survivors, and why each is left
 *
 * 29 mutations were run against `next/issues-view.ts` and `next/issues.ts`.
 * 26 were caught by a named test. The three that survive are recorded here
 * with their measurements rather than papered over:
 *
 * 1. **Filtering the issue list before sorting it instead of after.**
 *    Unfalsifiable by construction, not by omission: removing elements from a
 *    sorted list leaves the survivors in the same relative order, so the two
 *    orders are equal for *every* input. `issueEntries` keeps upstream's
 *    order (`issues.html:3037` then `:3040`) because it is upstream's; no test
 *    can distinguish them and none pretends to.
 * 2. **Counting `run-if` skips as issues.** Measured: **0 of 189 SKIP entries
 *    in the fixture and 0 of 27,024 in the full pinned 21-day xpcshell file**
 *    carry a `run-if` message — `FORMATS.md` records that the generator
 *    already drops them from the aggregates. So the branch is correct and
 *    currently unreachable on every aggregate this page loads. It stays
 *    because a daily file *does* carry them (up to 2.7× the skip count) and
 *    `#date=<day>` loads one.
 * 3. **Renaming the `(no component)` bucket.** Measured: **0 of 10 fixture
 *    tests** lack a component, against **2 of 4,838** in the full file. The
 *    fixture cannot reach the branch. Left rather than asserted against a
 *    hand-built decoded file, which would be asserting a constant.
