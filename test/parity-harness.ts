/**
 * Shared machinery for the new-page-vs-CLI parity checks (`PARITY.md` §5).
 *
 * Not a test file. It holds the three things the per-page parity suites need
 * and that would otherwise be copied three times:
 *
 * 1. **`invoke`** — one CLI invocation against the checked-in fixtures, offline
 *    by construction. The same shape `cli-step5.test.ts` and `framing.test.ts`
 *    use, deliberately: `PARITY.md` §5's brief says to reuse how the CLI is
 *    already driven rather than inventing a third way.
 * 2. **`synthProfile`** — the piece that makes `try` comparable at all. See
 *    below.
 * 3. **`Divergence` / `assertDeclaredDivergences`** — the allow-list discipline
 *    `test/framing.test.ts` implements for CLI-vs-old-page, applied to
 *    new-page-vs-CLI. A declared divergence whose sides have converged fails.
 *
 * ## Why `synthProfile` exists, and what it is not
 *
 * The page and the CLI read the push from **different sources of the same
 * bytes**: `site/try.ts` parses the resource-usage profile in a web worker,
 * `cli/commands/try.ts` parses it with `parseTestMarkers`. There is no shared
 * `lib/` module for that step, so a parity check has to feed both the same
 * profile.
 *
 * `test/fixtures/try-7d16bff81bb1.json` holds the **page side already parsed**
 * — its `timings` were produced by running the page's own worker source over
 * the push's 39 parseable profiles (`test/try-view.test.ts` documents the
 * capture). What it does not hold is the profiles themselves, which are tens of
 * megabytes.
 *
 * So `synthProfile` reconstructs a marker stream that re-parses to those
 * timings. That inverts the page's parser to build input for the CLI's, which
 * is a real limitation and is stated rather than hidden: it means the two
 * parsers are compared **through** a reconstruction, so a difference in how
 * they read a marker shape the fixture does not contain is invisible here. What
 * it does catch is every difference in what the two do with a marker stream
 * they both see — measured: it found two, both listed in `try-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * The reconstruction is checked, not assumed: `try-parity.test.ts`'s first test
 * re-parses every synthesized profile and asserts the result equals the
 * fixture's timings field for field, with the differences enumerated. If the
 * synthesis drifted, that test fails before any parity claim is made.

 * - A `TestStatus` marker named `FAIL` before a failing timing that carries a
 *   message. Both parsers take a failing test's message from the `TestStatus`
 *   markers inside its time range rather than from the `Test` marker, so a
 *   message written only onto the `Test` marker would be dropped by both and
 *   the comparison would be of two empty strings.
 * - A `Crash` marker before a timing with a `crashSignature`, inside the
 *   timing's range so the claiming branch fires. A timing whose path has no
 *   test extension gets its crash marker placed **outside** any test range,
 *   which is how a synthetic crash arises in the real data — a crash recorded
 *   during manifest teardown, with no running test to attribute it to.
 * - One `retry` Text marker spanning the reruns, because both parsers decide
 *   `isRetry`/`isRerun` by overlap with that range rather than from a field.
 *
 * No `parallel` range is emitted: the pinned push contains no `-PARALLEL` or
 * `-SEQUENTIAL` status, checked by `try-parity.test.ts`, so emitting one would
 * rewrite every status and compare something the push does not contain.
