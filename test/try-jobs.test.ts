/**
 * `lib/model/try-jobs.ts` — the job classification and selection both `try`
 * consumers now share.
 *
 * ## What this file is for, and the trap it is written around
 *
 * After an extraction, "the page and the CLI agree" is trivially true and
 * proves nothing: they call one function, so of course they agree. A test that
 * asserts it is a test of `===`. The dominant defect class in this repository
 * is a test whose expected value derives from the thing under test, and an
 * extraction is the easiest place in the world to write one.
 *
 * So every number below is a **literal read off `test/fixtures/try-7d16bff81bb1.json`
 * by code in this file that does not import `lib/model/try-jobs.ts`** — the
 * `rawCount` helper, a substring test written out inline. If the shared module
 * and this file were both wrong in the same way, comparing them to each other
 * would agree and comparing them to the fixture would not. Two of the numbers
 * (46 and 1,538) are the same ones `test/try-view.test.ts` and
 * `test/try-parity.test.ts` already pin, deliberately: they are the two the
 * `--all-jobs` defect turned on.
 *
 * The parity assertion that *is* worth making after the extraction is not
 * "both sides agree" but "both sides go through here at all", and that is not
 * assertable from inside this file. It is a mutation check, recorded at the
 * bottom.

/**
 * ## The mutation check
 *
 * Both consumers reaching this module is the property the extraction exists
 * for, and it cannot be asserted from inside this file — a test here would only
 * ever prove that this file imports it. It was checked by breaking the module
 * and counting the failures each side's own tests produce. "Page" is
 * `test/try-view.test.ts`, which never invokes the CLI; "CLI" is
 * `test/cli.test.ts` plus `test/framing.test.ts`, neither of which imports
 * anything from `site/`.
 *
 * | mutation | page fails | CLI fails |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `isTestJob` returns `false` | 4 of 74 | 42 of 178 |
 * | `isTestJob` returns `true` | 1 of 74 | 3 of 178 |
 * | `isFailureStatus` returns `false` | 25 of 74 | 38 of 178 |
 * | `selectTryJobs` ignores `readPassingJobs` | 1 of 74 | 3 of 178 |
 *
 * The last row is the one that found something. Both sides were red on the
 * first three immediately, and the page was **green** on the fourth: nothing in
 * `test/try-view.test.ts` observed the widening. The fixture holds profiles for
 * the failed jobs only, so a wider universe adds no row to assert on, and the
 * test that exists for the checkbox measured the two job sets with its own
 * filters without ever asking the selection for them. It now asserts
 * `jobsToProcess` against those independently-read counts, which is what turns
 * that cell red — the same defect one level down from the one `cde2ebd` fixed,
 * and the reason a mutation check is worth more here than another parity
 * assertion.

/**
 * ## Why these timings are written out by hand
 *
 * The bug this covers is a *semantic* one — every number in `18/18` was
 * arithmetically correct — so a test that recomputes the fraction from the
 * fixture would have passed before the fix and after it. What has to be pinned
 * is the shape of the run that produced it: `FAIL` followed by a passing
 * execution flagged as the harness's in-job rerun, in every run of every
 * configuration. That shape is three fields wide, so it is written here rather
 * than mined out of a profile, and the expected buckets are counted by hand
 * off the literals below.
