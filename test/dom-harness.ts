/**
 * A jsdom page, for the tests of `site/drilldown-render.ts` and the two page
 * controllers.
 *
 * Those three files were 2,598 lines that **no test imported**, because
 * importing a controller used to start the page. `55c9ff1` made the entry point
 * an exported `start()`; this module is the other half — the environment a node
 * test needs in order to call it.
 *
 * ## Why the real shared scripts, and not stubs
 *
 * `common-links.js`, `common-ui.js`, `common-charts.js` and `shared.js` are
 * plain scripts of top-level function declarations that the page loads by
 * `<script src=…>`. They are `eval`'d into the jsdom window here and lifted onto
 * `globalThis` under the names `site/` declares them with.
 *
 * Stubbing them instead would have been easier and worse, for the reason this
 * project keeps hitting: a stub's return value is a value *the test author
 * chose*, so an assertion on a link href would be checking the stub. Running the
 * real `getCrashViewerUrl` means the expected href in a test has to be written
 * out independently, and a controller that picked the wrong link builder fails.
 *
 * Four globals are **not** the real thing and each is a deliberate exception:
 *
 * - `fetchData` — the real one reaches the network. Here it serves
 *   `test/fixtures/`, which is what makes the suite offline.
 * - `createRateChart` — the real one needs Chart.js and a canvas 2D context,
 *   neither of which jsdom has. It is recorded instead, which also makes "was a
 *   chart drawn, with what series" assertable.
 * - `window.Chart` — the same exception one level down, for
 *   `site/issues.ts`, whose two chart kinds are the old page's own and go to
 *   Chart.js directly rather than through `common-charts.js`. Recorded with the
 *   whole configuration, and its `getChart` really does return the last chart
 *   made on a canvas, so a page that stopped destroying a chart before drawing
 *   over it is visible here rather than only in a browser.
 * - `getDataDateRange` is real, but `common-links.js` reads `data.metadata`; it
 *   works unchanged on the fixtures.
 * - `initHarnessSwitcher` is real and needs an `<h1>`, which `PAGE_HTML` has.

/**
 * This file declares no ambient globals, and that is the point.
 *
 * It used to declare `getBugButton`, because `site/failures.ts` called it
 * without declaring it: `tsconfig.site.json` compiles all of `site/**` as one
 * program, so the declaration in `site/test.ts` covered the call, while the
 * root project pulls in only the files a test imports and did not. The
 * declaration now lives in `site/failures.ts`'s own `declare global` block,
 * where the call is. Every `site/` module was checked for the same shape —
 * each compiled alone against the DOM lib with no other `site/` file in the
 * program — and `getBugButton` was the only one.
 *
 * What is still needed to import `site/` from a node test is the DOM half,
 * which the `/// <reference lib>` lines at the top of each test file supply.
