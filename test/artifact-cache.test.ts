/**
 * Caching of per-task artifacts, and the failure semantics it must not blur.
 *
 * The bug these tests pin: `fx-tests try <rev>` re-downloaded every job
 * profile on every run. Measured on try push 7d16bff8 before the fix — two
 * consecutive runs, 46 profiles each, 828 MB each, 48 network requests on the
 * warm run of which 46 were profiles. The named data files *were* cached, so
 * the cache was not broken; per-task artifacts simply bypassed it.
 *
 * A task's artifact is immutable — `<taskId>/runs/<retryId>/<path>` fully
 * determines the content — so unlike the nightly aggregates there is no
 * `generatedAt` to compare and no TTL to honour. That makes these a *better*
 * caching candidate than the files already cached, which is the point the
 * original "deliberately not the disk cache's" comment missed: distinct error
 * handling is a reason not to share the aggregates' semantics, not a reason
 * not to cache.
 *
 * ## What is asserted about absence
 *
 * Most of the value here is negative, and each negative is a way the fix could
 * be wrong while looking right:
 *
 * - a warm run makes **zero** artifact requests, asserted by counting calls on
 *   an instrumented fetcher rather than by timing anything;
 * - a **failure is never cached**, so a transient outage does not become a
 *   permanent-looking one;
 * - a 404 still produces **exit 4** and a 5xx **exit 3**, through the cache;
 * - `--no-cache` writes nothing and reads nothing.
 *
 * No test here touches the network: every fetcher is a counter over an
 * in-memory map, and every cache lives in a temporary directory the test
 * removes.
