/**
 * Builds the migrated dashboard pages in `site/` into self-contained HTML.
 *
 * ## Why a build exists here at all, when the other pages have none
 *
 * The dashboards are served exactly as they appear in the tree, and that is
 * worth keeping: editing a page and reloading it is the whole loop, with no
 * toolchain between the author and the browser. The migrated pages give that
 * up for one thing only — being able to `import` the typed, tested code in
 * `lib/` instead of carrying a fourth copy of it inline.
 *
 * The unmigrated pages are untouched by this script. It reads `site/` and
 * writes `dist-site/`; it never opens a page in the repository root, and
 * nothing it writes lands on top of one. A page is migrated exactly when its
 * source moves into `site/`, so there is no state where the same page has two
 * live definitions.
 *
 * ## Why the output is a single file with everything inlined
 *
 * A page that loads a shared `.js` alongside it can be served a stale copy of
 * one and a fresh copy of the other — the CDN caches them independently, and
 * this project has already lost time to exactly that (a deployed page throwing
 * `ReferenceError` from a cached shared script that no longer matched). Inlining
 * makes a page atomic: one request, one version, no skew possible between the
 * markup and the code it depends on.
 *
 * It also keeps the deployed artefact the same *kind* of thing as the pages it
 * sits next to — a static HTML file with its CSS and JS inside it — so the
 * migration does not change how the site is served.
 *
 * ## What is *not* inlined, and why that needs its own scan
 *
 * The shared `.js`, the CSS and the committed data files stay separate files
 * and are copied next to the built page. Which ones a page needs is worked out
 * by `tools/page-assets.ts`, over both the markup and the bundled code — see
 * that file for the bug that forced the second half of that.

/**
 * A page's Web Worker entry points, declared by the page's own markup.
 *
 * A page writes `<!-- worker: ./try-flakiness-worker.ts -->` and the build
 * bundles that entry separately, then makes the bundled source available to the
 * page's module as a string on `globalThis.__workers`. The page builds its
 * `Blob` from that string.
 *
 * ## Why a worker cannot simply be imported
 *
 * A `new Worker(new URL('./w.ts', import.meta.url))` would be a second request
 * for a second file, which is exactly the CDN-skew problem the single-file
 * output exists to prevent (see the note at the top of this file). So the
 * worker's code has to travel *inside* the page, as text.
 *
 * That leaves the question of where the text comes from, and the answer cannot
 * be `.toString()` on the imported functions — which is what `try.html` does
 * today (`try.html:2584`) and what forced this build change. `.toString()`
 * returns the *bundled* source of a function: esbuild has renamed its
 * identifiers, and its transitive dependencies are other renamed functions that
 * a `.toString()` of the top one does not include. The concatenated program
 * would reference names that do not exist in the worker's scope and throw
 * `ReferenceError` on the first message — silently, because the page's `catch`
 * treats a worker error as "no history for these tests".
 *
 * Giving the worker its own entry point makes esbuild's job the ordinary one:
 * it follows the imports, inlines the bodies, and emits a self-contained
 * program. `checkWorkerSelfContained` asserts that it really is.
