/**
 * The on-disk cache, and the reason a warm run costs no network at all.
 *
 * The aggregate files are tens of megabytes and change once a night, so
 * `CLI.md` asks for a cache "keyed by URL plus the file's
 * `metadata.generatedAt`". That phrasing hides a bootstrapping problem worth
 * being explicit about, because getting it wrong is how a cache ends up
 * "working" while still making a request every time:
 *
 * **`generatedAt` is inside the file.** You cannot key a lookup on it before
 * you have the bytes, so a cache that literally keyed on (URL, generatedAt)
 * would have to fetch the file to find out which cache entry to read — which
 * is the opposite of a cache. A conditional request (`If-Modified-Since`) is no
 * better: it is still a round trip, and `CLI.md` says a warm run should need
 * **no network at all**.
 *
 * So the split here is:
 *
 * - The **lookup key is the URL** (index + filename), hashed. That is what a
 *   caller knows before fetching.
 * - **`generatedAt` is recorded in the entry**, read from the bytes after a
 *   fetch. It is what the entry reports for provenance — `fx-tests cache`
 *   lists it, and every command prints the generation time of the data it
 *   used, so a stale answer is visible rather than silent.
 * - **Freshness is a TTL**, defaulting to the nightly cadence. Within the TTL
 *   the cached bytes are used with no request; past it the file is re-fetched
 *   and the new `generatedAt` recorded.
 *
 * That is what "keyed by URL plus generatedAt" can actually mean for a cache
 * that has to answer before it fetches, and the honest version of it: the URL
 * addresses the entry, `generatedAt` identifies which generation the entry
 * holds.
 *
 * ## Layout
 *
 * Two files per entry under the cache directory: `<hash>.json` holding the
 * bytes and `<hash>.meta.json` holding the metadata. Separate because the data
 * file is the thing that is tens of megabytes, and listing the cache
 * (`fx-tests cache`) should not read any of it.
 *
 * The bytes are stored verbatim rather than re-serialized: the cache is a
 * `DataSource` decorator and the contract is bytes in, the same bytes out.
 *
 * ## The second kind of entry: a completed task's own artifact
 *
 * Everything above describes the nightly aggregates. Per-task artifacts —
 * `fx-tests try`'s one resource-usage profile per failed job, and
 * `fx-tests crash`'s minidump — are a different shape, and the reasoning that
 * kept them out of the cache entirely was over-applied. Distinct *error
 * handling* (a 404 is exit 4, permanently gone; a 5xx is exit 3, try again) is
 * a good reason not to reuse the aggregates' semantics. It is not a reason to
 * skip caching, and skipping it made `fx-tests try <rev>` re-download 828 MB
 * on every single run — measured on try push 7d16bff8: 46 profiles, 4.7 MB to
 * 34 MB each, median 14.2 MB.
 *
 * A completed task's artifact is **immutable**. `<taskId>/runs/<retryId>/…`
 * fully determines the content; there is no `latest` that moves and no
 * `generatedAt` to compare. So these entries:
 *
 * - are keyed by the **artifact URL**, which is what the caller has;
 * - carry **no TTL**. Revalidating an immutable object is a round trip to
 *   learn something the key already told you. `TASK_ARTIFACT_KIND` marks them
 *   so `get()` knows not to expire them;
 * - are **bounded by total size** rather than by age, because unbounded is not
 *   acceptable at 828 MB per push. `pruneTaskArtifacts()` evicts the
 *   least-recently-fetched until the budget is met.
 *
 * Nothing negative is ever cached — see `cachedArtifactFetcher`.

 * the return value, so caching `null` would preserve a transient outage as if
 * it were an expired artifact, and a run made during a Taskcluster hiccup
 * would keep reporting missing profiles long after they were reachable again.
 *
 * The asymmetry is what settles it: caching a success can only ever be right,
 * because the content is immutable; caching a failure can be wrong, and the
 * wrong version is sticky. So a miss re-fetches, which costs one request on a
 * genuinely expired artifact and correctness on every transient one.

 *
 * **The job list is worth caching and can be cached safely.** It is 561 KB and
 * 0.3 s for a 1,731-job push (measured on try push 7d16bff8), and once every
 * job has finished it cannot change except by a retrigger — see
 * `isSettledPush` for why that is the condition rather than a TTL, and
 * `SETTLED_PUSH_TTL_MS` for why the entry still expires.
 *
 * **The push lookup is not.** It is 3.5 KB and 0.25 s, so there is little to
 * win, and it is the request that *resolves* a revision — including a
 * 12-character prefix, which can in principle match a different push later.
 * Caching the cheap half of a pair to save a quarter of a second, at the price
 * of resolving a revision from memory, is the wrong trade. It also keeps the
 * failure mode simple: `PushNotFoundError` for a push that does not exist yet
 * stays a live answer rather than a remembered one.
