/**
 * Loading published files, and resolving `--day` / `--since` against the
 * window they cover.
 *
 * The day logic is the part worth reading, because `CLI.md` makes a claim that
 * is easy to implement wrongly in a way that still produces plausible output:
 *
 * > **Within the 21-day window, `--day` and `--since` are both just filters.**
 *
 * Every status group in a bucket file carries a delta-encoded `days` array —
 * passes, skips, failures, crashes and timeouts alike — so restricting to one
 * day happens during the single pass the command already makes. **`--day` must
 * not fetch a daily file.** The daily files are 10× the size, cover different
 * skips (`FORMATS.md`: the aggregates drop `run-if`, the daily files keep
 * them), and disagree on job membership, so a command that quietly switched
 * families for `--day` would be comparing two different populations depending
 * on a flag.
 *
 * Only two things genuinely need a daily file — per-run timestamps and task
 * IDs for *passing* runs — and both are triggered by the flag that needs them,
 * never by `--day`.
 *
 * ## Day indices
 *
 * A bucket file's entries carry a `day` in `0 … days-1`, **oldest first**, and
 * `metadata.endDate` is the newest. So the date of day *d* is
 * `endDate - (days - 1 - d)` days, and that arithmetic lives here once rather
 * than in each command.
