/**
 * `fx-tests intermittent` — the sheriff-annotated top offenders, tree-wide.
 *
 * Every other view in this CLI is scoped by path, component or push and reads a
 * nightly aggregate. This one is tree-wide and reads a live API, so its rows are
 * *annotations* rather than failures: a failure nobody triaged has no row. It
 * ranks what costs sheriffs time; `issues` and `flaky` rank what fails most.
 *
 * The ranking API has no harness parameter, so `--harness` is a client-side scan
 * at one request per candidate bug — see `lib/query/intermittents.ts`. The list
 * is therefore a prefix of the ranking, and every run prints its own depth.
