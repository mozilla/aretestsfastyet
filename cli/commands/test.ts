/**
 * `fx-tests test <path>` — everything about one test.
 *
 * The workhorse, and the command that has to answer "why is this test failing,
 * and is it my fault?" without the caller having to know anything about the
 * data.
 *
 * Reads **one 64-bucket file**: 21 days of history for ~3.5 MB, against a
 * daily file's ~37 MB and 5× the heap (`FORMATS.md`). `--day` and `--since`
 * are filters on that same file, not a reason to fetch another one — every
 * status group carries a delta-encoded `days` array, so a day range costs
 * nothing extra. See `cli/data.ts` for why that matters.
 *
 * ## What the default output does and does not show
 *
 * `CLI.md`'s design goal is "answers, not dumps": a verdict first, then the
 * numbers behind it, then the failing configurations. Passing configurations
 * are behind `--coverage` because the default question is "what is broken",
 * and a 34-row table where 31 rows say `ok` buries the three that do not.
 *
 * Execution detail follows `PLAN.md` §5's assumption: the verdict mentions
 * initial-vs-rerun and parallel-vs-sequential only **when they change the
 * interpretation**, and the full breakdown is behind `--executions`. A test
 * that fails 20 times in parallel and once sequentially is a different bug
 * from one that fails evenly, and saying so in the verdict is worth one line;
 * printing both tables always is not.
