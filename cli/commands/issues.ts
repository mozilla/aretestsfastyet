/**
 * `fx-tests issues`, `failures`, `crashes` and `skips` — the tree-wide views.
 *
 * Four commands in one file because they read the same file, take almost the
 * same options and differ only in what they group by. Splitting them would
 * duplicate the loading, the filters and the "which file can answer this"
 * reasoning below four times.
 *
 * ## The file cannot attribute configurations, and that is not an empty result
 *
 * These read `{harness}-issues.json`, which is 2.8 MB because it **gave up all
 * attribution**: it has no `taskInfo`, its groups carry no `jobNameIds`, and so
 * every per-configuration query over it returns nothing whatever the test.
 *
 * `computeConfigStats()` returns `[]` on it, and `[]` means two entirely
 * different things — "no configuration failed" and "this file cannot say".
 * `canAttributeConfigs()` exists for exactly that distinction, and these
 * commands are where it becomes load-bearing: `fx-tests test` reads bucket
 * files and so never exercises it, which is why step 4 could leave the guard
 * untested. Here, `--config` is **refused** rather than silently matching
 * nothing, because a filter that quietly drops every row looks identical to a
 * tree with no failures.
 *
 * The escape hatch is real and is named in the message: `issues-with-taskids`
 * carries task attribution on the non-passing groups, at about 5× the bytes.
 *
 * ## `run-if` is not a disabled test
 *
 * `fx-tests skips` excludes `run-if` by default: it means the test is scoped to
 * another platform, so it not running here is the annotation working rather
 * than work someone owes. `--include-run-if` keeps them.
 *
 * The measured asymmetry matters for how that is reported. `FORMATS.md`: the
 * 21-day aggregates **already dropped** `run-if` upstream, while the daily
 * files keep them — 253,252 of 398,212 skipped runs on one daily file, 63.6%.
 * So on the aggregate these commands read, `--include-run-if` changes nothing
 * at all, and saying "excluded 0" would imply there were none to exclude rather
 * than that the generator got there first. The output says which population it
 * is reporting.
