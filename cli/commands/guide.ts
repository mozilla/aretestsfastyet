/**
 * `fx-tests guide` — orientation for an agent, in one read.
 *
 * The reason this exists is that the traps in this data are not discoverable
 * from `--help`. That the errors files are per-date with no aggregate, that a
 * manifest's all-zero durations mean skipped rather than instant, that
 * `issues.json` cannot attribute a failure to a configuration, that a test's
 * overall failure rate understates a single-config perma-fail: an agent that
 * reads this first stops re-deriving them, and one that does not will
 * confidently get them wrong.
 *
 * ## Why the facts are data and the prose is not
 *
 * `CLI.md` is explicit, and it is the whole design of this file:
 *
 * > **Its factual claims should be test assertions, not prose to remember to
 * > update.** "Review it when caveats change" is the mitigation that always
 * > fails.
 *
 * So everything mechanically checkable — which command reads which file, that
 * `errors` defaults to mochitest, what each exit code means, which flags exist
 * — lives in the exported tables below rather than in a string. `test/guide.test.ts`
 * asserts each entry against the **behaviour**: it dispatches the command, reads
 * the real option specs, compares against `ExitCode`. A guide that drifts from
 * the code fails the suite rather than quietly misleading a reader.
 *
 * What stays hand-written is the part no test can check: why a trap matters,
 * and how to approach an investigation. That prose is the reason to have a
 * guide at all — it is also the part that goes stale most slowly, because it
 * describes the shape of the data rather than the shape of the code.
 *
 * ## Properties, not snapshots
 *
 * A first version of this file ran to 242 lines and documented **the state of
 * the deployment on the day it was written**: that the errors files existed for
 * "about 5 of the 21 dates", that a measured day had 71,272 zero durations out
 * of 433,836, that `run-if` skips were 63.6% of one day's total. Every one of
 * those drifts, none of them would ever be updated, and the review that caught
 * it put the objection exactly right: the error-file generator had landed five
 * days earlier, so what?
 *
 * A fact that will be wrong next month is worse in a guide than a fact left
 * out, because the guide's whole claim on the reader is that it is the thing to
 * trust first. So the rule applied throughout is:
 *
 *  - **State the shape, not the measurement.** "Errors data covers fewer days
 *    than the timing data" is durable; "about five of twenty-one" is a reading.
 *  - **Where a number must be current, get it at runtime.** `fx-tests errors`
 *    discovers and prints its own window, so the guide points at the command
 *    instead of quoting it.
 *  - **Keep implementation detail only where it changes what the reader does.**
 *    Which JSON file a command opens is internal. That `test` reads one small
 *    per-test file is worth saying, because it is why `--day` is free.
 *
 * The traps that survived are the ones `CLI.md` names as the reason `guide`
 * exists: they are not discoverable from `--help`, they have been got wrong in
 * practice, and each is a property of how the data is produced rather than of
 * what it currently contains.
 *
 * Kept well under `profiler-cli guide`'s ~400 lines, per `CLI.md`, and well
 * under half the length of that first version: the target is a guide someone
 * finishes, not one that merely fits a budget.
