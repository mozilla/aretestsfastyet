/**
 * `fx-tests flaky` — which folder to book a flakiness-burndown session on.
 *
 * `flaky.html` leads with two charts, because "is the tree getting better?" is a
 * shape and a page can draw one. This command leads with something else, and the
 * difference is deliberate: the question a terminal is asked is *where do I spend
 * the afternoon*, and the answer to that is a ranked list of directories with
 * enough on each row to weigh the work against the payoff.
 *
 * So the default view is the page's **flat list**, not its tree and not its
 * charts. See `folderList()` for why the two rankings differ and why the flat one
 * is the actionable one: the tree puts `toolkit` first by virtue of containing
 * everything, and nobody can book a session on `toolkit`.
 *
 * ## The default window is a 7-day average of per-day classifications
 *
 * Both obvious choices are wrong, in opposite directions, and the default had to
 * be neither.
 *
 * **Not the whole 21 days.** `lib/query/flakiness.ts` opens with the measurement:
 * over the window 84% of xpcshell tests have failed at least once, because a test
 * runs on dozens of configurations dozens of times a day. Ranked that way the top
 * folders read 75%, 92%, 99% and nothing discriminates — `netwerk/test/unit` is
 * 437 of 582 and `js/xpconnect/tests/unit` is 148 of 149.
 *
 * **Not one day either**, which is the trap a per-day classification walks into
 * next: weekend push volume is 2.6× lower (`FORMATS.md`), so a single day's counts
 * are partly a fact about the weekday. Measured on the pinned window,
 * `netwerk/test/unit` reads 137 flaky on Tuesday and **76 on Sunday** — a 1.8×
 * swing from the calendar — and `dom/indexedDB/test/unit` is 4th on Sunday and 3rd
 * on Monday at more than double the count. Someone running this on a Monday would
 * be ranking Sunday's fraction of the runs.
 *
 * So the default is `DEFAULT_AVERAGE_DAYS` (7) days of *per-day* verdicts,
 * averaged: a whole number of weeks, so the weekday mix cancels, and still a daily
 * denominator rather than the window's inflated one. `flaky.html`'s headline tiles
 * average the same 7 days (`site/flaky-view.ts`'s `AVERAGE_WINDOW`), so the two
 * agree by construction. The counts are therefore **means per day and are
 * fractional** — 187.0 rather than 187 — which is the honest shape for "on a
 * typical day this folder has 187 flaky tests" and is why the columns carry a
 * decimal.
 *
 * `--day <date>` still ranks one named day and `--all-days` still ranks the whole
 * window, because both are real questions; the header always says which of the
 * three it printed. That is the bug `flaky.html` shipped and had to fix — tiles
 * showing one day above a table showing 21, with nothing saying so.
 *
 * ## What the columns are for
 *
 * A reader choosing between candidates needs the work, the payoff and the risk
 * that the work is not worth doing:
 *
 * - **flaky** — how many test files are flaky *directly in this folder*. The
 *   work. `selfFlaky`, not the subtree roll-up.
 * - **flaky%** — that as a percentage of the folder's own tests. Separates a
 *   rotten folder from two bad files in a healthy one, which want opposite
 *   responses and have the same flaky count.
 * - **skip** — how many of its tests are disabled somewhere. Ground already
 *   given up, usually the same underlying problem, and often the cheapest win.
 * - **tests** — the folder's population, so `flaky%` has a visible denominator.
 * - **+subtree** — the subtree's flaky count, printed only when it differs from
 *   the folder's own. That one column is the whole reason the tree view does not
 *   need to be a second table: it says "and there is more below here" without
 *   showing it.
 *
 * Two of those five were renamed after review, because the names did not carry
 * their meanings and the header block was already eight lines long — so the fix
 * had to be in the names rather than in more prose. `share` was read as a share
 * of the *issues* on the row (flaky/(flaky+skip)) rather than of the folder's
 * tests; `flaky%` sits directly under `flaky` and next to `tests`, which is the
 * ratio it is. `in tree` was read as "is this folder in the tree"; `+subtree`
 * leads with the `+` that says it is an addition to the number on its left.
 * `--sort share` still works, and is still spelled `share`, because a sort key is
 * an input a script may already have written down.
 *
 * ## Drilling in: `--group-by tests`
 *
 * A ranking's answer is a folder, and the next question is always which files.
 * `fx-tests issues --path <folder> --group-by test` answers a *different*
 * question and misleads badly here: it ranks by issue runs, and skips dominate
 * those. Measured on the pinned window for `toolkit/components/telemetry/tests/
 * unit`, it puts `test_UserInteraction_annotations.js` first with 6,879 issues,
 * **6,782 of which are skips** — a test this classification calls skipped and
 * not flaky. So the drill-down is here, on the same classification and the same
 * window as the ranking above it, reached as `fx-tests flaky <path>` or
 * `--group-by tests`. See `testRows()`.
 *
 * "The same window" is now true and was not. The listing passed no window option
 * to `flakinessByFolder` at all, so it inherited that function's own default of
 * the most recent day — a default written for the folder table. Measured on the
 * pinned file for `toolkit/components/telemetry/tests/unit`, the ranking scores
 * the folder over 7 days and the listing showed **29** flaky tests where **32**
 * were flaky across those days: three tests the ranking counted were absent from
 * the drill-down of it. The listing now takes one verdict per test over the same
 * 7 days — flaky if flaky on any of them — so drilling in is a refinement of the
 * row rather than a different question. `listingTree()` has the mechanism.
 *
 * The two numbers still differ, and both are right: the ranking's 26.7 is a mean
 * per day, the listing's 32 is a count of distinct tests. Only the *window* is
 * shared, and the header says so.
 *
 * ## Flaky and skipped overlap, and the header says so
 *
 * A test that fails on Linux and is disabled on Windows is both. Measured on the
 * pinned window, 800 of 4,807 tests are in both columns, so `flaky + skip` is not
 * a total and the two percentages have different denominators. `OverlappingCounts`
 * has the reasoning; the preamble states it, the way `issues` states which
 * outcomes it counted.
 *
 * The `--group-by days` view is the exception: it uses the mutually exclusive
 * classification, so its three columns *do* sum to `total`. The two views are
 * labelled differently for exactly that reason.

 * `test/flaky-tests-listing.test.ts` asserts they agree leaf for leaf.
 *
 * ## The default window is the ranking's, and used not to be
 *
 * With neither `--day` nor `--all-days` this passed **no window option at all**,
 * so `flakinessByFolder` fell through to its own default of the most recent day —
 * a default written for the *folder* table, where a single day is the right unit,
 * and inherited here by omission. The ranking above it scores over
 * `DEFAULT_AVERAGE_DAYS` days, so drilling into a row crossed a window boundary
 * with nothing saying so. Measured on the pinned file for
 * `toolkit/components/telemetry/tests/unit`: the ranking scores 7 days, and the
 * listing showed **29** flaky tests where **32** were flaky in those 7 days.

 * per-test verdict can take over several days: `allDays` bounded by `fromDay`,
 * flaky if flaky on **any** of them. Still 0/1 per test, still no means, still
 * `windowState`'s precedence — a test flaky on one of those days and skipped on
 * another is flaky-and-skipped, as it is under every other scope.
 *
 * **The two numbers are not the same quantity and must not be forced to match.**
 * The ranking's 26.7 is a mean per day; this listing's 32 is a count of distinct
 * tests flaky at least once in the window. Both are correct over the same 7 days,
 * and the header states the relationship rather than leaving a reader to notice
 * that 32 > 26.7.

    //   from `flakinessByFolder`, whose leaves are 0 or 1 (measured: two distinct
    //   values in each of `flaky`, `skipped`, `stable` across 4,807 leaves,
    //   `total` always 1). This view now reads the same derivation — see
    //   `listingTree` — so `7 of 7` to say "always" is gone along with the
    //   arithmetic that produced it.
    //
    // What survives, and why each earns a column on every row:
    //
    // - **`flaky` and `skipped`, 0 or 1**, exactly as the page shows them. Both,
    //   not one: the flaky-vs-skipped distinction is the entire reason this view
    //   exists rather than `fx-tests issues`, which let a skipped test top a list
    //   a reader would read as "most flaky". `1  1` is both, `0  1` is switched
    //   off rather than failing.
    // - **`failures`**, kept, because it is the only column with real resolution —
    //   272 distinct values up to 5,200 against 2 for each verdict — and the only
    //   thing separating "failed twice" from "failed 2,543 times". It is a count
    //   of *runs* over the file's whole window rather than of days in the scope,
    //   which is what made it read as a jumble beside three day-counts; with the
    //   day-counts gone it is the one number on the row, and its header names the
    //   window so the different unit is visible rather than implied.

/**
 * Renders a suggested `fx-tests` invocation carrying the flags that reproduce
 * this run's context.
 *
 * A footer that prints a copy-pasteable command is promising the reader it
 * answers the question they are looking at. It did not: `fx-tests flaky
 * --harness mochitest` suggested `fx-tests flaky <directory>`, and because a
 * **directory** has no filename for `detectHarness()` to classify it falls
 * through to the xpcshell default — so the suggestion silently answered about
 * the wrong harness. `detectHarness` rescues the per-test footer, whose argument
 * is a file (`browser_*.js` infers mochitest), and cannot rescue the two
 * directory-argument ones. Rather than depend on which suggestions happen to
 * take a filename, every one of them goes through here.
 *
 * ## What is carried, and what is not
 *
 * - **`--harness`, only when it is not the default.** `--harness xpcshell` on
 *   the common path is noise on a footer that is already being trimmed for
 *   length, and xpcshell is what an omitted flag means anyway.
 * - **`--day`**, because it *is* the question, and every target accepts it: it
 *   is a global. A table classified on one day whose footer suggests a command
 *   reverting to the 7-day mean sends the reader to different numbers than the
 *   ones they picked a row from — the same mismatch `headerLines` names the
 *   window to prevent.
 * - **`--all-days`, `--average-days` and `--noise` only for `fx-tests flaky`**,
 *   which is the only command that has them. They are not globals: `skips` and
 *   `test` would reject them as unknown flags (`cli/args.ts` rejects rather than
 *   ignores), turning a suggestion into an error. `flakyScope` is the opt-in.
 * - **Not `--limit`, `--json`, `--markdown` or the cache flags.** They shape
 *   *this* rendering, not the question, and a reader who wants them still has
 *   them typed in their own scrollback.

 * The provenance lines every view prints.
 *
 * ## Only what varies between two invocations
 *
 * This block used to open every run with the standing definitions — what "flaky"
 * means, what "skipped" means, why the window is a whole number of weeks, that
 * the flaky and skip columns overlap. Measured on the pinned window,
 * `flaky --limit 5` was 24 lines of which **13 were preamble** (955 characters,
 * ~238 tokens) before the reader reached a number, against 4 lines for
 * `issues --limit 5`. A primary consumer of this CLI is an agent, which pays
 * that on every invocation and needs the explanation at most once, so the
 * standing definitions moved to `flaky --help` (`FLAKY_NOTES`) and `docs/CLI.md`.
 *
 * What stays is what a reader cannot recover from the digits in front of them,
 * and each line here is one a wrong reading of would be a factor-of-several
 * error:
 *
 * - **which window produced the table.** `flaky.html` shipped a bug where the
 *   tiles showed one day above a table showing 21 with nothing saying so; naming
 *   the window in both places was the fix, and dropping it here would recreate
 *   it. The three scopes read 48%, 53% and 75% on the same folder.
 * - **the harness, the file's window and its test count** — the first line,
 *   which every command in this tool opens with.
 * - **how many tests the noise filter neutralised**, when it neutralised any,
 *   because that changes every count below it. Silent when it neutralised none:
 *   "0 tests neutralised" is a line that cannot change a reading.
 * - **which selection ran** on the per-test view, since on 4 of 250 pinned
 *   folders `--here-only` and the subtree differ and the tables look alike.
