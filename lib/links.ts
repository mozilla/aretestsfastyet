/**
 * URL builders: Taskcluster artifacts, Treeherder, the profiler front end,
 * Searchfox, Bugzilla.
 *
 * Pure string construction, which is why it is worth having once rather than
 * inline in nine pages. The port from `common-links.js` is mostly mechanical.
 * One thing about it is not, and it is the reason this module exists as its own
 * step rather than as a footnote to `sources/`.
 *
 * ## The split: raw artifact URL vs profiler front-end URL
 *
 * `getProfilerUrl()` (`common-links.js:16`) does two things in one expression:
 * it derives the artifact URL of a profile, and it wraps that URL in
 * `profiler.firefox.com/from-url/…`. Fusing them was fine when every consumer
 * was a browser, and it is wrong now that one is not:
 *
 * - **A page** wants the wrapper. Its consumer is a human who will click the
 *   link and read a flame graph.
 * - **The CLI** wants the bare artifact URL. Its consumer is `profiler-cli`,
 *   which downloads and parses the profile itself, and for which a front-end
 *   URL is not merely unhelpful but unusable — it is an HTML page, not a
 *   profile.
 *
 * So the two halves are separate functions here, and the wrapper takes a URL
 * rather than deriving one. `profilerFrontEndUrl(resourceUsageProfileUrl(…))`
 * reproduces the old behaviour exactly, and the CLI simply omits the outer
 * call.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of profile, and only one is derivable
 *
 * | kind | filename | derivable from the task ID? |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | resource-usage, one per job | fixed: `profile_resource-usage.json` | **yes** |
 * | per-test failure profile | appears only in the failure message | **no** |
 *
 * The second is the trap. A test that fails uploads a profile captured at the
 * moment of failure, under a name derived from the test — and the only place
 * that name is recorded is the failure message itself
 * (`"… profile uploaded in profile_foo.js.json"`, parsed at `try.html:2900`).
 * There is no listing to consult and no naming rule to apply: two tests in the
 * same job produce two different filenames, and a job where nothing failed
 * produced none at all.
 *
 * `uploadedProfileName()` therefore returns `null` rather than guessing, and
 * `CLI.md` makes the same promise to the user: where no profile was uploaded,
 * no URL is emitted.

 * `parseTaskId()` splits off a task ID's `.<n>` suffix — and not the harness's
 * within-job rerun, which has no URL of its own.
 *
 * Requests to this URL redirect to `firefoxci.taskcluster-artifacts.net` (303,
