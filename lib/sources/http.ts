/**
 * Taskcluster index URLs, and the redirect-base cache.
 *
 * Ported from `fetchFromCI()` (`fetch-utils.js:63`) with two changes, both
 * required by `PLAN.md` §2's layering rule and by having a second consumer.
 *
 * **The fetch is injected.** `lib/` must not call global `fetch`. The caller
 * passes a `FetchLike`, which the browser satisfies with `fetch` itself and
 * Node satisfies with `fetch` wrapped in a disk cache (step 4). This is also
 * what makes `sources/` testable without a network — every test in this repo
 * passes a fake.
 *
 * **The data source is configuration, not a sniff.** `getDataSource()`
 * (`fetch-utils.js:27`) reads `window.location.protocol` and `.hostname` to
 * decide between `local`, `try` and `central`. That is a reasonable default for
 * a page and is meaningless for a CLI, which has a `--data-source` flag
 * instead. So the choice is a constructor parameter; a page computes it from
 * its own URL and passes it in.
 *
 * ## The index namespace
 *
 * Verified by request, not inferred:
 *
 * ```
 * https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/api/index/v1/task/
 *   gecko.v2.{repository}.latest.source.test-info-{index}/artifacts/public/{filename}
 * ```
 *
 * This redirects to `firefoxci.taskcluster-artifacts.net`, where the bytes
 * actually are. Measured 2026-08-04: the status is **303**, not the 302 an
 * earlier note claimed. Immaterial to a `fetch`, which follows both, and
 * recorded because the number was written down wrong once.
 *
 * ## Why the redirect base is cached
 *
 * Every request to the index URL costs a redirect. `fetch-utils.js` remembers
 * the resolved prefix after the first response and builds subsequent URLs from
 * it, which turns *n* files into 1 redirect rather than *n*. The cache is
 * per-index — the point of the port is that there is more than one index — and
 * per-source, since `try` and `central` resolve to different tasks.
 *
 * The subtlety worth keeping: the resolved base is only good while the index
 * task is the same one. `latest` moves nightly, so a cached base outlives its
 * task and starts 404ing. A 404 against a cached base therefore **retries
 * against the index URL** rather than being reported as missing data, which is
 * a case `fetch-utils.js` does not handle because a page's lifetime is shorter
 * than a night.
