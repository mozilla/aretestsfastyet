/**
 * Per-configuration failure rates for a test, with a recent window sized by
 * run count.
 *
 * A **port**, not a rewrite. `computeConfigStats()`
 * (`common-test-data.js:121`) is the one piece of the existing data code that
 * already has its domain knowledge written down, and `PLAN.md` §3 is explicit
 * that the recent-window logic "should be moved, not rewritten". The comments
 * below are that code's reasoning, kept because they are the reason it is
 * right; what changed is that the shape dispatch is now the step-1 iterator's
 * job and the classification is `model/status.ts`'s.
 *
 * ## Why per-config at all
 *
 * The overall rate divides failures from every config by runs from every
 * config, so a test that fails **every time** on one platform still reads as a
 * couple of percent overall. Slicing by config is what makes a perma-fail
 * visible, and it is why `CLI.md`'s `fx-tests test` leads with a per-config
 * table rather than with a single number.
 *
 * ## Why the recent window is sized by runs and not by days
 *
 * The load-bearing property, and the one most likely to be "simplified" away by
 * someone who has not read this comment.
 *
 * Push volume drops several-fold at weekends — `FORMATS.md` measures 103.2M
 * markers on Thursday 2026-07-30 against 39.1M on Sunday 2026-08-02, a factor
 * of 2.6, and the same ratio on xpcshell. So "the last 7 days" measured on a
 * Monday covers two days that barely ran, and a config's recent failure rate
 * would rest on a handful of runs and swing wildly. A fixed day count is a
 * rate whose denominator depends on the calendar.
 *
 * Instead the window is widened until the **sparsest** config has accumulated
 * `minRecentRuns` runs, and then *every* config uses that same window. Two
 * consequences worth stating because both are deliberate:
 *
 * - All configs share one window, so their recent rates cover the same period
 *   and are comparable, and the window can be described to the user once as a
 *   number of days rather than as a different run count per config.
 * - A config too sparse to ever reach the minimum does **not** widen the window
 *   for everyone else. It simply gets no recent rate — `null`, not zero,
 *   because "not enough data to say" and "0% failures" are different claims.
 *
 * The window is anchored to the **newest day any config ran**, not to each
 * config's own last active day. Anchoring per config would give a config that
 * stopped running a week ago a full "recent" window taken from its own last
 * active days, which is not recent at all.
 *
 * `CLI.md`'s "recent (7d)" column is this window, and its width is an output
 * rather than a setting: the command prints the window it used.
 *
 * ## Why failures are counted twice over
 *
 * Every failure, and separately only those whose message matches one seen on
 * the try push. A test can fail for more than one reason on the same config, so
 * "this test fails 28% of the time here" and "it fails *this way* 28% of the
 * time here" are different claims — and only the second one says the failure in
 * your push is pre-existing. `fx-tests try`'s known-intermittent section rests
 * on the distinction.
 *
 * Timeouts and crashes frequently record no message at all (`FORMATS.md`:
 * `TIMEOUT*` and `CRASH` groups carry no `messageIds`), so for those the status
 * kind stands in for the message — `matchAnyTimeout` / `matchAnyCrash`.
