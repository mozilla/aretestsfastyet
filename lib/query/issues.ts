/**
 * Tree-wide triage: what is failing, across every test in a file.
 *
 * Behind `fx-tests issues`. Where `test-stats.ts` answers about one test, this
 * walks every test in the file once and reports the ones that are not clean,
 * grouped however the caller asks.
 *
 * ## One pass, integer accumulators
 *
 * `PLAN.md` §4 is specific about this: aggregate in a single pass over
 * integer-indexed arrays rather than materializing per-occurrence objects. A
 * 21-day aggregate holds ~40M xpcshell runs and ~172M mochitest ones, so an
 * object per run is not viable. Each test contributes one row with six
 * counters, and rows are dropped as soon as they are known to be uninteresting.
 *
 * ## What "the population" is, and why this file will not mix families
 *
 * `FORMATS.md` measures that `issues.json`, `issues-with-taskids.json` and the
 * 64 bucket files are three encodings of the *same* 21 days: adding their
 * totals multiplies the population by the number of encodings, and an earlier
 * revision of that document quoted a figure 4× too large by doing exactly
 * that. Two agents have made the same mistake.
 *
 * The defence here is structural rather than documentary: every function takes
 * **one** `DecodedTimingFile`. There is no parameter to pass a second file
 * through, so there is no summing across families to get wrong. A caller that
 * wants both must call twice and compare, which is the operation that makes
 * sense — and even then, `FORMATS.md` now measures that the daily files and the
 * aggregates disagree on job membership as well as on skips, so the comparison
 * is not apples to apples either.
