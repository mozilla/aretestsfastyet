/**
 * Which of a push's jobs a try report is computed from.
 *
 * The layer between `lib/sources/treeherder.ts`, which fetches a push's jobs,
 * and the two things that read their profiles — `try.html` in a browser and
 * `fx-tests try` in node. Both had to answer the same three questions before
 * fetching anything: which jobs run a harness this tooling can parse, which of
 * those to read profiles for, and how many times each configuration ran. Both
 * answered them in their own code.
 *
 * That is the hole `cde2ebd` exposed. The page's "All jobs" checkbox and the
 * CLI's `--all-jobs` flag were two controls on different axes sharing a name;
 * fixing the flag made the two sides *agree*, but by writing the rule a second
 * time rather than by sharing it, so the next divergence had the same room to
 * grow. `isTestJob` was defined twice, character for character, and nothing
 * would have failed if one copy had gained a harness.
 *
 * ## What is here, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Here: **what to read**. `selectTryJobs` partitions a push and names the set
 * whose profiles the caller should fetch.
 *
 * Not here: **how to read it**. The page fetches through a pool of Web Workers
 * that parse in the worker and post timings back; the CLI fetches through a
 * disk cache with a `--concurrency` bound and a streamed-profile check. Those
 * differ for real reasons and are not a duplication to remove — one of them
 * cannot run in the other's runtime. The boundary is drawn exactly at the job
 * list because that is the last point at which the two are answering the same
 * question.
 *
 * Also here: the status classification the selection travels with
 * (`isFailureStatus`, `runKeyOf`). Those were duplicated the same way and are
 * read on the same objects, so splitting them across two modules would leave
 * the next reader looking in two places for one rule.
 *
 * ## `retry` vs `rerun`, which is the other half of the same bug
 *
 * The two sides also **name** the harness's in-job rerun differently, and that
 * is not cosmetic: it is why nothing lined the `--all-jobs` defect up. The
 * concept has three spellings in this repository.
 *
 * | side | field on a timing | derived flag |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `site/` | `isRetry` | `passedOnRetry` |
 * | `cli/` | `isRerun` | `passedOnRerun` |
 * | `lib/model/execution.ts` | — | `passedOnRerun` |
 *
 * They are the same thing, and `passedOnRerun` is the name this repository has
 * settled on — `lib/model/execution.ts` owns the concept and spells it that
 * way. A grep for it finds 19 hits in `cli/` and **none** in `site/`, which
 * reads as "the page does not have this feature" and is false.
 *
 * It is not renamed here, and the reason is a hard boundary rather than
 * reluctance. `isRetry` is set inside `WORKER_CODE` in `site/try.ts` — a
 * `String.raw` block carried verbatim from `old/try.html:862`, which that file
 * documents as untouched precisely so bundling cannot alter marker semantics.
 * The field then crosses a `postMessage` boundary into the page. Renaming it
 * means editing the verbatim block, which is a behaviour risk on the profile
 * parser taken for a vocabulary win. The table above is the cheap half of the
 * fix: a reader who greps either spelling now finds the other.
 *
 * Note the third confusion the names invite and that neither side has: the
 * job-level retry, Taskcluster's `runs/<n>`, is `retryId`, and it is a
 * different axis from both. `runKeyOf` below is built on that one.

 * the failures. Note the asymmetry with `EXPECTED-FAIL`, which the profile
 * parser produces for a `FAIL` marker coloured green and which is **not** here:
 * an annotation that fired as intended is not news.
 *
 * `ERROR` is here too. The parser emits it for a `Test` marker whose status is
 * literally `ERROR`, which mochitest uses for a harness-level problem inside a
 * test's range.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* `classifyStatus`'s `isFail`. `lib/model/status.ts` answers
 * "did this run reach a failing verdict" for the published aggregates, where
 * `UNEXPECTED-PASS` does not occur and `EXPECTED-FAIL` is its own kind. A try

 * `browser_878452_drag_to_panel.js` exposed on try push 7d16bff81bb1: it failed
 * in all 18 runs of the 12 configurations it failed on, and the harness's in-job
 * rerun turned every one of those 18 runs green. `18/18` is arithmetically
 * right and reads as "this test never once passed", which is the opposite of
 * what happened. Only `passedOnRetry === 18` says what the push actually did.
 *
 * Counting job runs rather than executions is deliberate and is the axis the
 * fraction is on. A failing execution is a different unit — the harness reruns
 * a failing test, so one job run can hold two of them — and conflating the two
 * is what `PARITY.md` §1 records as a user-reported defect.
