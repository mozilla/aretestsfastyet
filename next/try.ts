/**
 * `try.html`, migrated onto `lib/`.
 *
 * The third and last of the three page migrations, following the split the
 * first two settled:
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/` | data and derivations: config stats, test stats, the bucket hash, chunk stripping, status classification | node tests, shared with the CLI |
 * | `next/try-view.ts` | the view model — every decision, and everything naming an id, a class or a glyph | `test/try-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | `next/try-flakiness-worker.ts` | the worker, as its own esbuild entry point | the browser run |
 * | this file | turning those decisions into elements, and the interactions | the browser parity run |
 *
 * ## What the migration removes
 *
 * `common-test-data.js` — the *data* logic, of which `lib/` already had a typed,
 * tested version. The page no longer loads it, and the tag is gone rather than
 * left dead (leaving one was a defect in the previous migration). All six
 * functions this page reached into it for have `lib/` replacements:
 * `getChunkIndex` → `bucketIndexForPath`, `findTest` → `DecodedTimingFile.findTest`,
 * `computeTestStats`, `computeConfigStats`, `stripChunkSuffix`, `detectHarness`.
 * `getCountAtIndex` has no direct replacement because it does not need one:
 * `lib/formats/decode.ts` yields decoded entries, so nothing indexes a status
 * group by hand any more.
 *
 * **Verified before removal**: no consumer remains. `common-test-data.js`'s
 * seven globals are referenced nowhere in this page's source, nowhere in the
 * five shared scripts that still load, and nowhere through a `window.*` lookup;
 * the grep is in the page's own HTML comment. Removing the tag drops 15,636
 * bytes the page downloaded and never called.
 *
 * The other five shared scripts **stay, loaded by name**. `fetch-utils.js`,
 * `dashboards.js`, `common-ui.js`, `common-links.js` and `shared.js` are UI
 * plumbing with no `lib/` equivalent, up to 22 unmigrated pages depend on them,
 * and `tools/build-pages.ts` copies them next to the built page.
 *
 * ## The two workers
 *
 * This page runs two, and they were migrated differently for a reason worth
 * stating because it is the only asymmetry here:
 *
 * - **The profile worker** (`WORKER_CODE`, below) is unchanged, still a template
 *   literal. Measured: the old page's copy has **zero `${}` interpolations** and
 *   references nothing outside itself, so it is already a complete program and
 *   bundling cannot touch it. Rewriting it as an entry point would have been
 *   churn with a real risk of changing marker semantics.
 * - **The flakiness worker** could not survive bundling at all, because the old
 *   page built it by `.toString()`-ing six `common-test-data.js` functions. It
 *   is now `next/try-flakiness-worker.ts`, its own esbuild entry point; see that
 *   file's comment for the failure mode, and `tools/build-pages.ts` for how the
 *   bundled text reaches the page.
 *
 * ## Declared divergences from `try.html`
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §4: byte-identical is the default and every exception is declared.
 * **This list is the whole set.** The previous migration wrote four entries plus
 * a paragraph of prose and the largest divergence lived only in the prose, so
 * anything that makes a parsed-DOM diff non-empty is a numbered entry here.
 *
 *  1. **Inline handler attributes become `addEventListener`.** The largest DOM
 *     difference by far. Upstream emits `onclick="toggleTest('…')"`,
 *     `onclick="sortTable('count')"`, `onclick="event.stopPropagation()"`,
 *     `onclick="copyMachCmd('…', event)"`, `onclick="toggleUnblamedGroup(3)"`,
 *     `onclick="return onProfilerClick(event, '…', …)"`,
 *     `onclick="toggleAssertions(this, '…')"` and the four control-bar handlers
 *     as **attributes**; this page attaches the same handlers with
 *     `addEventListener` and emits none of them. Behaviour-preserving, but not
 *     invisible: an inline handler needs a *global* function, which is what tied
 *     the old page's rendering to module scope, and removing them is what lets
 *     this file be a module.
 *
 *     The measured counts are in this file's browser evidence; every `on*`
 *     attribute the old page writes is one this page does not.
 *
 *  2. **The `#` column's `escapeAttr(test.path)` id becomes a `Map` lookup.**
 *     Upstream writes `id="flakiness-${escapeAttr(test.path)}"` and
 *     `id="repro-icon-${escapeAttr(test.path)}"` and finds the cell again with
 *     `document.getElementById('flakiness-' + testPath)` — **unescaped**
 *     (`try.html:2849`, `:3605`). Those two spellings disagree for any path
 *     containing `&`, `<` or `"`. No such path exists in the corpus (measured: 0
 *     of the 138 failing paths across the four pinned pushes), so the mismatch is
 *     latent rather than live. Here the renderer keeps the elements in a `Map`
 *     keyed by the raw path and the ids are gone, which removes the class of bug
 *     rather than reproducing it. **A DOM diff sees this as two absent `id`
 *     attributes per row.**
 *
 *  3. **`copyMachCmd` / `copyDebugJson` / `onProfilerClick` read a real event.**
 *     Upstream passes `event` through an inline attribute and reads
 *     `event.currentTarget`. Here the listener has the element. Same behaviour,
 *     no reliance on the attribute-scope `event` binding.
 *
 *  4. **The assertion "show N more" link toggles a class, not `style.display`.**
 *     Upstream writes `style="display:none"` on each hidden `<li>` and flips
 *     `el.style.display` (`try.html:3090`). The markup already carries an
 *     `assertion-hidden` class for exactly these items, so this page toggles
 *     `hidden` on them instead of writing inline styles. A DOM diff sees the
 *     absent `style` attribute; the rendered result is identical because
 *     `assertion-hidden` is not styled in `shared.css` — verified by grep — so
 *     upstream's inline `display:none` was doing all the work and the class was
 *     already inert.
 *
 *  5. **`renderUnblamedJobs` is keyed by group key, not by render index.**
 *     Upstream emits `onclick="toggleUnblamedGroup(${groupIdx})"` and resolves
 *     the index against `unblamedRenderedKeys`, a module-scope array written by
 *     the last render (`try.html:1981`, `:2108`). That is a stale-index hazard —
 *     the array is rewritten on every search keystroke while the click is
 *     pending — and here the listener closes over the key itself. Same rows
 *     expand; the indirection is gone.
 *
 *  6. **The `no-failures` empty state is built from parts.** Upstream's
 *     `noFailuresHtml()` returns a string with the Treeherder link interpolated
 *     into it; here `noFailuresText()` returns the verdict, the caveat and
 *     whether the caveat carries a link, and the renderer builds the anchor. The
 *     rendered text is identical — the tests assert it — but the view model can
 *     be checked without a DOM.
 *
 *  7. **The local reproduction subsystem is not migrated, and its controls are
 *     emitted disabled.** The largest *behavioural* omission, and the only one
 *     on this list that removes a capability rather than re-expressing one.
 *
 *     Upstream drives a local test runner over `ws://localhost:3000`
 *     (`try.html:3206`) to re-run failing tests and report whether each
 *     reproduces: roughly 20 functions and 550 lines, spanning `reproState`, the
 *     per-config run queues, the cached-history fetch, the per-row repro icons
 *     and detail rows, and the `Reset` button. None of it is here.
 *
 *     What this page emits instead: `#extra-args`, `#reproduce-btn` and
 *     `#repro-reset-btn`, in the same places, gated on `isLocal` exactly as
 *     upstream gates them, all three `disabled` with the title `Local
 *     reproduction is not available in this build`. Upstream would have enabled
 *     the button (failures exist, nothing is running — `updateReproduceButton()`
 *     third branch, `try.html:3186`) and given it the title `Connect to local
 *     test-runner and attempt to reproduce failures`.
 *
 *     **Why disabled rather than absent.** An earlier revision of this file
 *     emitted the button *enabled* with no handler, with a comment claiming it
 *     was "emitted disabled" — the code two lines down set `disabled` from
 *     `failures.tests.length`, which is always non-zero where this runs.
 *     Measured in Chrome: old `{visible:true,disabled:false,hasOnclick:true}`,
 *     new `{visible:true,disabled:false,hasOnclick:false}`; clicking it changed
 *     nothing. The parity diff could not catch that, because **a DOM diff cannot
 *     tell a working button from an inert one** — satisfying it by restoring
 *     markup turned a known gap into a hidden one. Disabling is what makes the
 *     omission visible in the artefact the diff actually compares.
 *
 *     These controls only render when the page is served from localhost, so a
 *     deployed page shows none of them and is unaffected.
 *
 *     Two knock-on effects, both stated where they happen: the last column's
 *     width term `(hasRepro || isLocal)` reduces to `isLocal` (`renderTable`),
 *     and the search box does not scope reproduction runs the way upstream's
 *     `sendAllRunRequests` does (`try.html:3367` iterates `getFilteredTests()`)
 *     because there are no runs to scope.
 *
 * Everything else — the row unit, the three tables and their split rule, the
 * sort keys and their directions, the `UNEXPECTED-PASS` failure status, the
 * `totalJobs` denominator, the headline-rate argmax, the search box's `!`
 * negation, the URL state, and the `window.failures`/`permaFails` seams — is
 * reproduced, and the reasoning for each lives next to the code that does it in
 * `next/try-view.ts`.

 *    and `tools/build-pages.ts`'s parse guard — `new Function`, which is not a
 *    module scope — rejects it. That guard exists because the symptom of a
