/**
 * `manifests.html`, migrated onto `lib/`.
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/formats/manifests.ts` | the file format, shared with the CLI | `test/formats.test.ts` |
 * | `lib/query/manifest-stats.ts` | the CLI's answer to the same question | `test/step5-query.test.ts` |
 * | `next/manifests-view.ts` | this page's view model — aggregation, sorting, filtering, paging, URL state | `test/manifests-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | this file | the renderer, the Plotly charts and the interactions | `test/manifests-page.test.ts` + the browser run |
 * | | the two sides against each other | `test/manifests-parity.test.ts` |
 *
 * ## The shared drill-down was considered and **not** used
 *
 * `next/drilldown-view.ts` / `drilldown-render.ts` were extracted for
 * `crashes.html` and `failures.html`. The judgement, with the table of shape
 * differences behind it, is at the top of `next/manifests-view.ts`. In one
 * line: that drill-down's bottom level is an **occurrence rendered as a table
 * row**, and this page's bottom level is a **`<td colspan=5>` holding a Plotly
 * scatter** — there is no per-run row here at all. Add to that two search
 * boxes rather than one, fixed 50-row paging rather than virtualization,
 * duration statistics with a genuine absent case rather than counts, and a
 * middle level that is a job name with no path structure to collapse.
 *
 * What **is** reused, because it really is page-independent: `drilldown-render`'s
 * `el()` and `noData()`, and its `declare global` block describing the shared
 * scripts. `el()` is the one that earns its keep — it answers the escaping
 * question once, which is what lets this file delete the old page's
 * `escapeHtml`/`escapeAttr` pair and its eleven `innerHTML` assignments.
 *
 * ## What the migration removes
 *
 * **The string-concatenation renderer.** Upstream builds each cell by
 * concatenating HTML into `innerHTML` (`manifests.html:651`, `:664`, `:702`,
 * `:741`, and six more), which is what forces `escapeHtml` (`:866`) and
 * `escapeAttr` (`:872`). `escapeAttr` is **dead on this page** — measured:
 * `grep -c escapeAttr manifests.html` is 1, its own definition, and no call
 * site exists. Both are gone.
 *
 * **The global functions the markup calls.** `sortBy`, `prevPage`, `nextPage`,
 * `clearSearch`, `updateClearButtons` and `filterManifests` are `onclick=` /
 * `oninput=` attributes in upstream's markup, which is why they had to be
 * globals. See divergence 2 for what happens to them here.
 *
 * `common-test-data.js` is **not** loaded, and was not loaded before either:
 * `grep -c common-test-data manifests.html` is **0**.
 *
 * ## Plotly stays, and the charts are ported
 *
 * The brief asked for this to be a deliberate decision rather than a default,
 * and it was made by measuring the old page rather than by reading it: driven
 * in Chrome against the pinned 2026-08-04 file, expanding a manifest and then a
 * job produces **one** element carrying Plotly's `js-plotly-plot` class and a
 * `modebar`, so the chart is live and worth having rather than decoration.
 *
 * So the CDN tag stays (`next/manifests.html:7`, byte-identical to
 * `manifests.html:7`), the third level is ported, and the two click handlers on
 * it — plain click opens the resource profile, Alt+click the error summary —
 * are ported with it. Nothing here emits a chart element that never draws;
 * that mistake has been made twice on this project and the check against it is
 * `test/manifests-page.test.ts`'s assertion that a chart container is only ever
 * created together with a `Plotly.newPlot` call for the **same** id, plus the
 * browser run's count of `.js-plotly-plot` elements.
 *
 * `Plotly` is a CDN global here, exactly as it is upstream. Under jsdom there
 * is no CDN and no WebGL, so `test/manifests-page.test.ts` installs a recorder
 * in its place and asserts on what the page handed it — the same exception, and
 * for the same reason, that `test/dom-harness.ts` documents for Chart.js.
 *
 * ## Declared divergences from `manifests.html`
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §4: byte-identical is the default and every exception is
 * declared. **This list is the whole set** — one enumerated list, with no prose
 * elsewhere carrying an extra entry.
 *
 *  1. **The keystroke sort-flip is fixed, and with it the page's first paint.**
 *     This is the one behaviour change that a reader will see immediately, so
 *     it is first and it is measured.
 *
 *     Upstream's `filterManifests()` ends with `sortBy(currentSortColumn)`
 *     (`:611`). `sortBy` toggles the direction when handed the column already
 *     selected (`:488-490`), so *every* call flips the sort. `filterManifests`
 *     is called from `oninput` on both boxes (`:285`, `:295`), from
 *     `clearSearch` (`:563`) and from `loadData` (`:909`); `popstate` does the
 *     same thing inline (`:937`).
 *
 *     Measured in Chrome, pinned 2026-08-04, comparing the Median header's
 *     indicator and the first rows:
 *
 *     | step | old | new |
 *     | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | first paint | `▲` ascending | `▼` descending |
 *     | first paint, rows reading `SKIP` | **50 of 50** | **0 of 50** |
 *     | first paint, top row | `dom/payments/test/mochitest.toml`, SKIP | `/html/cross-origin-opener-policy`, 16m 2s |
 *     | typing `browser` | `▲` | `▼` |
 *     | one more key, `browsers` | `▼` | `▼` |
 *     | `history.back()` | `▼` → `▲` | `▼` |
 *
 *     The first paint is the reason this is fixed rather than reproduced. The
 *     302 manifests that ran nowhere have no median; upstream stores `0` for
 *     them, so an ascending sort puts all 302 first and they fill **six** pages
 *     of 50. The page exists to answer "which manifest is eating the budget",
 *     and it was opening on seven pages of manifests that did not run, under a
 *     header claiming the default was descending (`:361`).
 *
 *     The fix is in two parts, both in this file: filtering does not sort
 *     (`applyFilters` re-applies the *current* sort rather than calling the
 *     toggle), and a skipped manifest's sort value is `-1` rather than `0`
 *     (`columnValue` in the view model), so it sorts last under either
 *     direction rather than first under one of them.
 *
 *  2. **Inline handler attributes become `addEventListener`, and the eight in
 *     the markup now throw once each on use.** The markup is byte-identical, so
 *     `oninput="updateClearButtons(); filterManifests()"` on the two inputs,
 *     `onclick="clearSearch(…)"` on the two × spans, `onclick="sortBy(…)"` on
 *     the five headers and `onclick="prevPage()"` / `nextPage()` on the two
 *     buttons are all still attributes — but a module has no globals, so each
 *     is a `ReferenceError` and the listener attached by this file does the
 *     work.
 *
 *     Measured in Chrome on the pinned file: clicking a header logs exactly one
 *     `Uncaught ReferenceError: sortBy is not defined` and the table re-sorts
 *     correctly; typing one character logs one
 *     `updateClearButtons is not defined` and the table re-filters. This is the
 *     arrangement `next/crashes.html`, `next/failures.html` and
 *     `next/errors.html` already ship, and it is listed rather than fixed
 *     because fixing it means editing the markup, which the brief forbids.
 *
 *     Every handler the old page *generates* is gone: `row.onclick`
 *     (`:648`), `jobRow.onclick` (`:696`). Those were properties rather than
 *     attributes, so they do not appear in a count of `on*` attributes — the
 *     honest measurement is that the old page's rendered `#manifestTableBody`
 *     carries **0** `on*` attributes and this one also carries 0, and the
 *     difference is that upstream attaches one closure per row per render
 *     while this file attaches **one** delegated listener to the `<tbody>` for
 *     the life of the page.
 *
 *  3. **Next is disabled on an empty result.** Upstream computes
 *     `totalPages = Math.ceil(0 / 50) = 0`, renders `Page 1 of 0`, and disables
 *     Next only when `currentPage === totalPages` (`:757`) — which is `1 === 0`,
 *     false. Measured in Chrome: searching `zzzzznotamanifestzzzzz` leaves Next
 *     **enabled**, and clicking it does nothing at all, because `nextPage`
 *     guards separately with `currentPage < totalPages` (`:859-860`). A control
 *     that is enabled and inert is worse than a disabled one — a
 *     `DOM diff cannot tell a working control from an inert one`, which is
 *     exactly why this was found by clicking it rather than by reading it. The
 *     comparison is `>=` here. The `Page 1 of 0` text is **unchanged**.
 *
 *  4. **`currentPage = 1` takes effect before the render, not after.**
 *     Upstream assigns it *after* `sortBy` has already re-rendered
 *     (`:611-612`, and again at `:937-938`), so the first paint after a search
 *     or a `popstate` shows the old page number against the new result. Measured
 *     in Chrome: with `?job=wdspec` narrowed to 5 pages, going to page 2 and
 *     then pressing Back renders **"Page 2 of 5"** — the pager label, the
 *     disabled states and the 50 rows shown are all page 2 of a result the page
 *     has just decided starts at page 1. Any later render corrects it, which is
 *     what makes this hard to see and worth fixing. Here the page number is
 *     part of the state the render reads, so there is no window.
 *
 *  5. **The `manifest-row` / `job-row` click targets are delegated, and a click
 *     on a job row no longer needs `stopPropagation`.** Upstream attaches a
 *     handler to the manifest row and another to the job row, and the job
 *     handler must call `e.stopPropagation()` (`:697`) or expanding a job would
 *     also collapse its manifest. One delegated listener on the `<tbody>`
 *     resolves the *nearest* row and acts on that, so the two cannot both fire.
 *     Same behaviour, one listener; the `stopPropagation` is gone because there
 *     is nothing left to stop.
 *
 *  6. **Expansion state survives a re-render by identity, not by re-lookup.**
 *     Upstream re-renders the whole `<tbody>` on every toggle (`:636`) and
 *     re-derives which rows are open from two `Set`s of strings. This file does
 *     the same — the sets are the state — but the row elements are held in a
 *     `Map` to their rows so the click handler never has to find a row again by
 *     selector. No behaviour change; recorded because it is the mechanism the
 *     crashes/failures migration found a real quoting defect in.
 *
 *  7. **No tie-break is added to either sort.** Upstream's manifest comparator
 *     (`:495-506`) and job comparator (`:447-450`) both leave equal rows in
 *     input order, and `lib/query/manifest-stats.ts` breaks ties on the name.
 *     The page's behaviour is kept: adding a tie-break would reorder real rows
 *     against the page being compared, and the input order is deterministic
 *     (the file's own) so nothing reshuffles between reloads. This is a
 *     declared *non*-change, listed because the CLI comparison will show the
 *     two orders differing on ties.
 *
 *  8. **The median rule differs from the CLI's, and both are kept.** The page
 *     takes the upper middle element, `summarize` the nearest-rank quantile —
 *     the lower middle for an even sample. Measured on the pinned 2026-08-04
 *     file: **3,122 of 6,227** manifests get a different overall median. Not a
 *     divergence this migration introduces; it is a divergence this migration
 *     is the first to *measure*, and `test/manifests-parity.test.ts` pins it so
 *     it cannot drift into an accident. See the note at `medianOf`.
 *
 *     `test/framing.test.ts:437-440` says the opposite — "The CLI's `medianOf`
 *     matches it deliberately". There is no function called `medianOf` in
 *     `lib/` or `cli/` (there is now one in `next/manifests-view.ts`, added by
 *     this migration), and `test/step5-query.test.ts:401` pins the CLI's rule
 *     to nearest-rank with `[10 … 100] → 50`, where this page gives 60. That
 *     comment is wrong and is left alone only because `test/framing.test.ts`
 *     is outside this migration's write scope; it is reported rather than
 *     edited.
 *
 *  9. **Duration formatting stays the page's, which is not the CLI's.**
 *     `formatDuration` floors the seconds of a minute value and has no hour
 *     form, so `1m 59s` and `120m 0s`; `cli/commands/manifests.ts:459` rounds,
 *     pads, and has one. Presentation only — the underlying milliseconds are
 *     compared in the parity test, not the strings.
 *
 * 10. **The chart element id keeps its non-injective slug.** Two manifest names
 *     of the 6,227 collide under `[^a-z0-9] → -`. Kept; see `chartElementId`.
 *
 * 11. **The four stat cards are unchanged, and two of them do not describe the
 *     table.** Total Jobs is the length of the `jobNames` string table (4,165)
 *     where only 859 job names appear on a run, and Total Runs (494,380)
 *     counts the 78,957 zero-duration runs that every Runs cell excludes. This
 *     is upstream's meaning, reproduced exactly, and recorded because the
 *     numbers invite a comparison with the table that they do not survive.
