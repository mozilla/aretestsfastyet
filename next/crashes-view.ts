/**
 * `crashes.html`'s **view model**: what is left of the page's decisions once
 * the drill-down it shares with `failures.html` has been factored out.
 *
 * Almost everything structural lives in `next/drilldown-view.ts` — the tree, the
 * ranking, the path collapse, the totals, the URL state. This file is the part
 * that is *only* true of the crashes page:
 *
 * - the row unit is a **crash signature**, and an unsymbolized one is dropped;
 * - a row has **two raw-count columns and no rate column**;
 * - an occurrence can carry a **minidump**, which is what makes a row a link
 *   into the crash viewer rather than into the profiler.
 *
 * ## Why so little is here
 *
 * That is the point of doing the two pages as one job. An earlier plan would
 * have produced a `crashes-view.ts` and a `failures-view.ts` each carrying its
 * own copy of `expandGroup`, `sortRows`, `totalsOf` and the occurrence walk, and
 * then a third change to reconcile them. What genuinely differs between the two
 * pages turns out to be small and mostly about links, so that is what these two
 * files hold.
 *
 * ## This file must stay DOM-free
 *
 * Enforced indirectly: `test/crashes-view.test.ts` imports it, the root project
 * compiles `test/**`, and the root project has no DOM lib.
