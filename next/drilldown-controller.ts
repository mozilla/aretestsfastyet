/**
 * The **controller** the crashes and failures pages share: page state, the
 * expansion state machine, data loading, the URL hash, and startup.
 *
 * ## Where this sits
 *
 * The migration already split these two pages three ways — `lib/` for the file
 * formats, `next/drilldown-view.ts` for the view model, `next/drilldown-render.ts`
 * for the renderer — and then left the controllers alone. They were 897 and 922
 * lines that a normalized diff put at 82% identical. This file is the fourth
 * piece:
 *
 * | file | contains |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `next/drilldown-view.ts` | the tree, the ranking, the collapse, the totals, the URL state |
 * | `next/drilldown-render.ts` | the elements, given a `Vocabulary` and `RenderHooks` |
 * | this file | the state, the clicks, the fetches and the hash |
 * | `next/crashes.ts` / `next/failures.ts` | one `PageSpec` each, and what only that page does |
 *
 * It belongs in `next/` and not in `lib/`, under this project's seam rule: it
 * names `#content`, `#statusText`, `#dateSelect`, `#searchBox`, `.path-row`,
 * `.test-row`, `sort-header`, `total-row`, `expanded` and `historical-chart`.
 * `lib/` gains nothing from this change.
 *
 * ## The seam
 *
 * `PageSpec` extends the pattern `Vocabulary`/`RenderHooks` already established:
 * a record of the decisions the shared code cannot make. It deliberately has
 * **no booleans**. This codebase's rule is that a helper needing three flags to
 * serve its callers is several functions, and the two places the pages genuinely
 * disagree are both expressed as *values the page supplies* rather than as
 * branches here:
 *
 * - **What a row expands to.** `PageSpec.rank` returns the ranked rows *and* the
 *   `expandable` map every expansion reads. The crashes page returns the whole
 *   unfiltered tree, so its rows expand to everything regardless of the search;
 *   the failures page returns the search-rewritten subtrees, so its rows expand
 *   to what matched. That is the entire asymmetry, and it is one map rather than
 *   an `if`. See `RankedList`.
 * - **Which series a chart gets.** `PageSpec.chartSeries` is handed the level, the
 *   key, the path and the search term and returns a series. The crashes page
 *   ignores the term; the failures page has two search-filtered variants. See
 *   `ChartRequest`.
 *
 * ## What is *not* here, and why
 *
 * `loadFromUrlHash` and the `onHashChange` body are **not** shared. The two
 * pages disagree about them on purpose and it is on both files' declared
 * divergence lists: the failures page clears a stale search box (`state.q ?? ''`)
 * and re-renders on a hash change while in the 21-day view, and the crashes page
 * reproduces upstream's bug of doing neither. Sharing them would need two flags
 * to reconstruct exactly the pair of behaviours the divergence lists promise, so
 * each page keeps its own — and each keeps the paragraph explaining why, next to
 * the code.
 *
 * ## Tested through the pages
 *
 * There is no `test/drilldown-controller.test.ts`, deliberately: this module has
 * no meaningful behaviour without a `PageSpec`, and a test that supplied a
 * hand-made one would be asserting against a spec its own author wrote.
 * `test/crashes-page.test.ts` and `test/failures-page.test.ts` drive it through
 * the two real specs in jsdom against pinned fixtures, which is what makes a
 * mistake here fail in both suites at once.
