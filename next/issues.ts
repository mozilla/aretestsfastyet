/**
 * `issues.html`, migrated onto `lib/`.
 *
 * The last and largest of the page migrations, and the only one with a
 * deliberate behaviour change (divergence 1 below).
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/query/issues.ts` | the per-test counters and the component grouping, shared with the CLI | `test/query.test.ts` |
 * | `next/issues-view.ts` | this page's view model — rows, sort, search, expansion, URL state | `test/issues-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | this file | the renderer and the interactions | `test/issues-page.test.ts` + the browser run |
 *
 * The judgement on whether to reuse `next/drilldown-view.ts`, with the table of
 * shape differences behind it, is at the top of `next/issues-view.ts`. In one
 * line: that drill-down is *key → dirPath → test → occurrence* with a two-number
 * row and a path-collapse rule, and this page is *component → test → issue
 * message → occurrence* with nine numbers a row and no path level at all.
 * `drilldown-render.ts`'s small DOM helpers **are** reused.
 *
 * ## What the migration removes
 *
 * **A second, private `computeTestStats`.** `issues.html:944-1097` is a
 * 150-line fork that is not `common-test-data.js`'s — the page never loads that
 * file (`grep -c common-test-data issues.html` is 0; its `<script>` tags are
 * `:7-10`). The fork and `lib/query/issues.ts` were compared per test and field
 * by field on 4,838 xpcshell tests, 21,016 mochitest tests and two daily files
 * before either was reused: **zero mismatches** on every displayed number. The
 * table and the one non-displayed difference (`EXPECTED-FAIL`, folded into
 * `passCount` by the page and named separately by the library) are documented
 * at the top of `next/issues-view.ts`, together with the Issue% denominator.
 *
 * **The string-concatenation renderer**, and with it the `escapeHtml`/
 * `escapeAttr` calls and the `onclick=` attributes that a global function had to
 * satisfy. Building nodes answers escaping once, at `el()`.
 *
 * The five shared scripts **stay, loaded by name**: `fetch-utils.js`,
 * `dashboards.js`, `common-ui.js`, `common-links.js` and `shared.js`. They are
 * UI plumbing with no `lib/` equivalent and up to 22 unmigrated pages depend on
 * them; `tools/build-pages.ts` copies them next to the built page. Chart.js
 * comes from the same CDN tag the old page uses (`issues.html:3820`), moved
 * ahead of the module script because a `type="module"` script is deferred and
 * the CDN one is not — so `Chart` is defined before any of this runs, which is
 * the ordering the old page gets for free from an inline `<script>`.
 *
 * ## The two files the 21-day view loads
 *
 * `{harness}-issues.json` is 2.8 MB of **counts only**: every status group is
 * the `counts` shape, there is no `taskInfo` key, and nothing in it says which
 * job saw a failure. It is what the page renders its numbers from.
 *
 * `{harness}-issues-with-taskids.json` is the same 21 days at 15.9 MB, with
 * `taskIdIds` on the non-passing groups and a `taskInfo` to resolve them
 * through. `loadDetailedData` fetches it in the background when a component is
 * opened and swaps it in, which is what upstream does (`issues.html:3403`) and
 * what three features need: the run list under a failure message, the
 * per-issue-message chart, and the platform tooltips. Without it those three
 * have nothing to show.
 *
 * **The swap does not move a displayed number.** Measured on the live 21-day
 * xpcshell pair rather than assumed: `testInfo`, `tables.statuses` and
 * `tables.messages` are byte-identical between the two files, both describe the
 * same 4,838 tests, and all **58,056** status groups have identical run totals.
 * `test/issues-page.test.ts` asserts the rendered rows are unchanged across the
 * merge on the fixtures, which is what would catch the day the two files drift.
 *
 * ## Declared divergences from `issues.html`
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §4: byte-identical is the default and every exception is
 * declared. **This list is the whole set** — one enumerated list, no prose
 * carrying an extra entry, because that is exactly how an entry went missing on
 * an earlier migration.
 *
 *  1. **The default window is the 21-day aggregate, not the single most recent
 *     day.** The one deliberate behaviour change on this migration, and the
 *     reason this page was sequenced last.
 *
 *     `issues.html` opens on one day: with no hash, `:3709-3712` calls
 *     `loadData()`, which reads the `date-select`'s first option. (The
 *     `isHistoricalMode = false` at `:666` is not itself the cause — it
 *     describes the state before the first load — so the real default lives in
 *     that branch rather than in the initializer.) This page treats an absent
 *     `date` as `21days` and loads `{harness}-issues.json`.
 *
 *     Requested by the owner — *"I always use the issues page with
 *     #date=21days in the url"*, and 21 days being the default *"would be an
 *     improvement"* — and already recorded as this migration's acceptance
 *     criterion by `test/framing.test.ts`, whose `issues`/`window` divergence
 *     said it "closes when the page migrates". That entry has been updated;
 *     see the note under "framing" below.
 *
 *     **Measured on the pinned xpcshell data**, which is what makes this a
 *     change of substance rather than of default:
 *
 *     | | 21-day aggregate | 2026-08-04 alone |
 *     | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | components with an issue | **133** | **87** |
 *     | tests in the file | 4,838 | 4,836 |
 *     | rank 1 | WebExtensions :: General, 584,427 | WebExtensions :: General, 32,349 |
 *     | rank 6 / 7 | Add-ons Manager, then Crash Reporting | **Crash Reporting, then Add-ons Manager** |
 *
 *     The top ten are the same ten components, so the change is not a different
 *     answer — it is a steadier one: 46 components that had a quiet day
 *     reappear, and a component that had one bad night stops out-ranking a
 *     component that is broken every day.
 *
 *     **Both windows still work.** `#date=2026-08-04` selects that day and
 *     loads the daily file, the "Show Single Day" button leaves the aggregate,
 *     and the two shapes are different files with different structures —
 *     `{harness}-issues.json` (counts only, no `taskInfo`) against
 *     `{harness}-<date>.json`. `test/issues-page.test.ts` drives both.
 *
 *  2. **Inline handler attributes become `addEventListener`, and the three in
 *     the markup now throw once each.** The markup is byte-identical, so
 *     `onchange="loadData()"` on the `<select>` (`:611`),
 *     `onclick="toggleHistoricalData()"` on the button (`:614`) and
 *     `onchange="updateIssueFilters()"` on the four checkboxes (`:626-638`) are
 *     still attributes — but a module has no globals, so each attribute handler
 *     is a `ReferenceError` and the listener attached by this file does the
 *     work. This is the arrangement `next/crashes.html`, `next/failures.html`
 *     and `next/errors.html` already ship, and it is listed rather than fixed
 *     because fixing it means editing markup the brief holds byte-identical.
 *
 *     Every handler the page *generates* is gone: `onclick="changeSortOrder(…)"`
 *     on each of the 8 sort buttons (`:1153`, `:1168`),
 *     `onclick="copyTestName(…); event.stopPropagation();"` and
 *     `onclick="event.stopPropagation();"` on each test row's two buttons
 *     (`:844`, `:850`), and `onclick="toggleIssueRuns(this, event)"` on each
 *     issue line (`:3070`).
 *
 *     **Measured in Chrome on the pinned snapshot**, counting `on*` attributes
 *     in the live DOM under `#tree-container`:
 *
 *     | state | old | new |
 *     | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | first paint, 21-day xpcshell, 133 components collapsed | **8** | **0** |
 *     | WebExtensions :: General expanded (393 test rows) | **794** | **0** |
 *     | one test expanded on top of that (7 issue lines) | **801** | **0** |
 *
 *     The 8 at first paint are the sort buttons; the 786 added by one expansion
 *     are two per test row.
 *
 *     Re-measured on the 2026-08-04 pinned snapshot after the detailed file was
 *     restored, in case emitting the tooltip cells had brought an attribute
 *     back: first paint **8 → 0**, `Core :: Networking` expanded (628 test
 *     rows) **1,264 → 0**. The tooltip cells carry `data-*` and no `on*`.
 *
 *  3. **`data-path` is no longer how a row is found again.** Upstream writes
 *     `data-path="${escapeHtml(componentName)}"` on each component row
 *     (`:2094`) and the raw test path on each test row (`:2166`), then resolves
 *     a click through `row.dataset.path` into `aggregatedData[path]`
 *     (`:2206`, `:2354`). Here the row elements are held in a `Map` to their
 *     rows, so nothing is resolved through an attribute. The attributes are
 *     still emitted with the same values, because the stylesheet and a reader's
 *     devtools both use them.
 *
 *     Unlike the same change on `failures.html` this fixes nothing measurable:
 *     a component name is `Product :: Component` and a test path is a file
 *     path, and **0 of the 136 component names and 0 of the 4,838 test paths**
 *     on the pinned snapshot contain a quote. It is listed because a reader of
 *     the code sees a different mechanism.
 *
 *  4. **`buildTotalSummaryRow` is not ported, because nothing calls it.**
 *     `issues.html:1833-1875` builds a `📊 Total` row. Verified rather than
 *     assumed, as the brief asked: `grep -n "buildTotalSummaryRow" issues.html`
 *     returns **exactly one line — the definition at `:1833`** and no call
 *     site; and driving the old page in Chrome through first paint, expansion,
 *     search, every checkbox and every column header never produces an element
 *     matching `.total-row`. So the migrated page has no total row, which is
 *     what the old page shows. (Contrast `crashes.html` and `failures.html`,
 *     whose total rows *are* rendered and are ported.)
 *
 *  5. **A component's chart is drawn from its *listed* tests, and the id it
 *     carries can collide.** The daily-rate charts, the platform tooltips and
 *     the run lists are all ported; what remains is two details of how the
 *     component chart is keyed and fed.
 *
 *     `calculateComponentDailyFailureRates` is handed `group.tests`
 *     (`:2192`) — the tests the search kept **and** that have an issue
 *     (`:2016`) — so a component's chart is not its whole population: the
 *     passes of its clean tests are not in the denominator, and typing in the
 *     search box narrows the chart as well as the rows. Both are reproduced
 *     rather than corrected, because the chart sits directly above the list of
 *     exactly those tests and charting a different set would not match it.
 *
 *     The chart's DOM id is `component-chart-${name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g,
 *     '-')}` (`:2136`), which maps `Core :: DOM` and `Core - DOM` to one id.
 *     Reproduced, and harmless on both pages for different reasons: upstream
 *     resolves the canvas by `getElementById` and would draw two components'
 *     charts into one canvas, while this page holds the canvas element and
 *     never looks it up by id. Measured on the pinned 21-day xpcshell file:
 *     **0 collisions among the 136 component names**, so neither page is
 *     currently wrong — the id is emitted because a reader's devtools sees it.
 *
 *  6. **The per-issue-message chart counts every matching status, not just the
 *     first.** This is the one place the migrated page deliberately computes a
 *     different number from `issues.html`, and it is a bug fix.
 *
 *     `calculateIssueMessageDailyRates` resolves an issue type to a single
 *     `targetStatusId` and `break`s (`:2574-2590`), then charts only that one
 *     group. `tables.statuses` on the pinned file is ordered `PASS-PARALLEL,
 *     SKIP, PASS-SEQUENTIAL, PASS, TIMEOUT-PARALLEL, FAIL-PARALLEL,
 *     EXPECTED-FAIL, CRASH, FAIL-SEQUENTIAL, TIMEOUT, FAIL,
 *     TIMEOUT-SEQUENTIAL` — so every FAIL line charts `FAIL-PARALLEL` alone and
 *     every TIMEOUT line charts `TIMEOUT-PARALLEL` alone.
 *
 *     **Measured on the live 21-day xpcshell aggregate**: 2,792 of the 3,788
 *     tests with any failure have more than one `FAIL*` group, and 214 have
 *     more than one `TIMEOUT*` group.
 *     `toolkit/components/backgroundtasks/tests/xpcshell/test_backgroundtask_automaticrestart.js`
 *     saw `[test_backgroundtask_automatic_restart : 23] 0 == 3` 48 times under
 *     `FAIL-PARALLEL` and 3 times under `FAIL`; upstream's chart accounts for
 *     48 of the 51.
 *
 *     Upstream is not *choosing* the first status here — it contradicts itself.
 *     The count printed on the issue line sums every `FAIL*` group, and the run
 *     list the same click opens explicitly collects **all** `FAIL*` status ids
 *     (`:3168-3172`). Only the chart uses one. Reproducing it would put a bar
 *     totalling 48 under a line reading 51 above a list of 51 rows, so the
 *     chart is made to agree with its neighbours instead. See
 *     `messageDailyRates` in `next/issues-view.ts`.
 *
 *  7. **A test row's Runs cell no longer turns red at zero.**
 *     `generateStatsHtml` (`:815`) passes `'fail'` when `runCount === 0`, and
 *     the component header's equivalent (`:2121`) passes nothing. A test with
 *     zero runs and an issue is a test that was **only** skipped, and colouring
 *     its Runs cell red says "this is broken" about a number that is correctly
 *     zero. Measured on the pinned 21-day xpcshell file: **312 of the 4,256
 *     tests with an issue** have `runCount === 0`, every one of them
 *     skip-only — so this is not a rare cell. The class is dropped and the
 *     Skips cell next to it, which is populated, is what tells the reader what
 *     happened.
 *
 * Everything else — the row unit, the hard-coded components view, the sort
 * fields and their per-column default directions, the four checkboxes changing
 * numerator and denominator rather than visibility, the search's two-level
 * match, the `(N tests with issues, out of M)` header, the issue-line ordering
 * and its two synthetic "not recorded" lines, the `?try=` short-circuit and the
 * `#date=…&q=…` state — is reproduced, and the reasoning for each lives next to
 * the code that does it in `next/issues-view.ts`.

/**
 * Fetches `{harness}-issues-with-taskids.json` and merges it in.
 *
 * `loadDetailedData` (`issues.html:3403-3452`), and the reason this page has it
 * at all: the 21-day aggregate the page opens on carries **no task
 * attribution** — `{harness}-issues.json` is the `counts` shape throughout —
 * so without this file a failure message has no runs to list and the
 * per-message chart has nothing to bucket. The detailed file is the same 21
 * days with `taskIdIds` on the non-passing groups.
 *
 * ## The four properties this reproduces
 *
 * **Historical mode only** (`:3405`). The daily files already carry task IDs.
 *
 * **At most one fetch** (`:3408`), guarded by `loadingDetailed` and
 * `detailedLoaded` — 15.9 MB is not a request to make twice, and expanding a
 * second component while the first fetch is in flight is the ordinary case.
 *
 * **A failure is a warning, not an error** (`:3417`, `:3449`). The page keeps
 * working on the counts-only file, which is what it was already showing.
 *
 * **Nothing waits for it.** The caller does not await; the reader's expansion
 * has already rendered.
 *
 * ## What the merge replaces, and what it cannot
 *
 * Upstream swaps four tables and `taskInfo` into the *live* `currentData`
 * object (`:3428-3444`) — and since `currentData === historicalData` (`:3561`),
 * the charts see the swap too. Two things follow that this page has to match:
 *
 * - **The displayed numbers must not move.** They do not, and that is measured
 *   rather than assumed: on the live 21-day xpcshell pair, all 58,056 status
 *   groups across 4,838 tests have identical run totals in the two files, and
 *   the `testInfo`, `statuses` and `messages` tables are byte-identical. The
 *   fixtures were checked the same way — `test/issues-page.test.ts` asserts the
 *   rendered rows are unchanged across the merge, which is what would catch a
 *   file that had drifted.
 * - **A partial merge must not be reachable.** Upstream's is: it assigns
 *   `testRuns` and `taskInfo` unconditionally and each table only
 *   `if (detailedData.tables.X)`, so a file with `taskIdIds` and no
 *   `tables.taskIds` leaves the page resolving task indices against the *old*
 *   table — silently wrong job names rather than an error. Here the file is
 *   decoded into a new `DecodedTimingFile` and swapped in with one assignment,
 *   so the page holds either the old file or the new one and never a mixture.
 *   `decodeIssuesWithTaskIds` is what fails loudly if the tables are missing.
 *
 * The re-render at the end is upstream's *absence*: upstream does not re-render
 * either (`:3446` just logs), because the numbers are the same and the reader
 * is looking at the page. What has changed is only what a *later* click finds.
