/**
 * `crashes.html`, migrated onto `lib/`.
 *
 * Migrated as **one job** with `failures.html`, because the two are near-twins:
 * same row/path/test/occurrence drill-down, same collapse rule, same ranking,
 * same URL state. Doing them separately would have meant porting that structure
 * twice. The split:
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/` | the file formats and the five status-group shapes | node tests, shared with the CLI |
 * | `site/drilldown-view.ts` | the shared view model: tree, ranking, collapse, totals, URL state | `test/drilldown-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | `site/drilldown-render.ts` | the shared renderer | the browser parity run |
 * | `site/drilldown-controller.ts` | the shared controller: state, clicks, fetches, hash | `test/crashes-page.test.ts` and `test/failures-page.test.ts`, in jsdom |
 * | `site/crashes-view.ts` | what is only true of this page | `test/crashes-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | this file | this page's `PageSpec`: its hooks, its chart walks, its URL rule | `test/crashes-page.test.ts` |
 *
 * The controller row is the newest. The two controllers were 897 and 922 lines
 * that a normalized diff put at 82% identical — the state, the four-level
 * expansion machine, the delegated click handler, `loadSelectedDate`, the
 * historical toggle and `start()` were the same code with the nouns swapped.
 * That is now `DrilldownController`, and what is left here is what genuinely
 * only this page does. **What was deliberately left duplicated** — the
 * search-box guard in `applyUrlState`, and the chart walk — is marked as such at
 * each site, with the reason.
 *
 * ## What the migration removes
 *
 * **The inline decoding of the status-group shapes.** `processCrashData`
 * (`old/crashes.html:225-374`) is 150 lines that branch on `isBucketedFormat` and
 * hand-decode `days` or `timestamps`, which covers two of the five shapes
 * `FORMATS.md` documents and silently misreads the other three.
 * `lib/formats/status-entries.ts` resolves all five and throws on a sixth.
 *
 * `common-test-data.js` is **not** loaded, and was **not loaded before either**
 * — unlike the three earlier migrations, this page never had the tag. Verified:
 * `grep -c common-test-data crashes.html` is 0, and none of its seven globals
 * (`detectHarness`, `getChunkIndex`, `getCountAtIndex`, `findTest`,
 * `stripChunkSuffix`, `computeConfigStats`, `computeTestStats`) appears in
 * either page's source. So there is nothing to remove here and no byte saved;
 * the brief's requirement that it stop being loaded is satisfied vacuously, and
 * saying so is more useful than implying a removal that did not happen.
 *
 * The six shared scripts **stay, loaded by name**: `shared.js`,
 * `fetch-utils.js`, `dashboards.js`, `common-ui.js`, `common-charts.js` and
 * `common-links.js`. They are UI plumbing with no `lib/` equivalent, up to 22
 * unmigrated pages depend on them, and `tools/build-pages.ts` copies them next
 * to the built page. `common-charts.js` in particular still owns the Chart.js
 * wiring and `getTestTotalRuns`, neither of which has a `lib/` counterpart.
 *
 * ## Declared divergences from `crashes.html`
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §4: byte-identical is the default and every exception is declared.
 * **This list is the whole set** — one enumerated list, no prose carrying an
 * eighth entry, because that is exactly how an entry went missing on an earlier
 * migration.
 *
 *  1. **Inline handler attributes become `addEventListener`.** The largest DOM
 *     difference by far. Upstream emits `onclick="sortBy('tests')"`,
 *     `onclick="sortBy('count')"` and `onclick="event.stopPropagation();"` on
 *     every occurrence link as **attributes**; this page attaches the same
 *     handlers and emits none of them. Measured in Chrome on the pinned
 *     snapshot, counting `on*` attributes in the live DOM: **old 2, new 0** at
 *     first paint (the two sort buttons), rising as rows are expanded — one per
 *     occurrence link. Behaviour-preserving, but it is what lets this file be a
 *     module instead of a bag of globals.
 *
 *  2. **`data-signature` is gone; rows are held in a `Map`.** Upstream writes
 *     `data-signature="${escapeAttr(sig)}"` on every row and finds a row again
 *     with `querySelector('[data-signature="' + escapeAttr(sig) + '"]')`
 *     (`:584`, `:597`). Here the renderer keeps the row elements in a `Map`
 *     keyed by the raw signature. **Measured: 0 of the 90 signatures on the
 *     pinned snapshot are affected by the escaping mismatch** — a signature is a
 *     symbol name and contains no quotes — so on this page the change removes a
 *     latent bug rather than a live one. (It is live on `failures.html`; see
 *     that file's entry 2.) **A DOM diff sees this as one absent attribute per
 *     row.**
 *
 *  3. **The total row's "Tests" number still overcounts.** It sums each row's
 *     test count, so a test that crashes with three signatures counts three
 *     times. Measured on the pinned snapshot: the row shows **1,098** where
 *     **676** distinct tests crashed, a 1.62× overcount, with 266 of those 676
 *     having more than one signature. **Reproduced unchanged.** The number is
 *     the sum of the column above it, a reader can check it by adding the rows
 *     up, and on a searched list it is the only number that responds to the
 *     search; replacing it with a distinct count would make it disagree with the
 *     column and with the reader's arithmetic, which is a product decision about
 *     a number a human reads rather than a migration's to make. The per-row
 *     count, by contrast, is *not* a double-count — see `GroupRow.testCount` for
 *     the measurement that establishes this.
 *
 *  4. **The search still hides rows without changing their numbers.**
 *     Reproduced exactly, including its two consequences: a surviving row shows
 *     its pre-filter counts and expands to tests that do not match, while the
 *     **total row does change** because it is summed after the filter. So under
 *     a search the total is the sum of the *whole* of each matching row.
 *     `failures.html` does the opposite; the difference is upstream's.
 *
 *  5. **An unsymbolized crash is still dropped.** Upstream skips a null
 *     signature (`:270`), where `lib/query/crashes.ts` deliberately keeps it as
 *     a `null` group on the grounds that an unsymbolized crash is still a crash.
 *     The page's rule is reproduced. Measured: **0 of 21,252 crash occurrences**
 *     on the pinned xpcshell snapshot have a null signature, so the two rules
 *     select the same runs here and this is a page-vs-CLI divergence rather than
 *     an old-vs-new one.
 *
 *  6. **A job name the file cannot resolve renders as empty, not `"undefined"`.**
 *     Upstream indexes `tables.jobNames[jobNameId]` with no guard, so a file
 *     with no `taskInfo` renders the string `undefined` into the cell. Here it
 *     is an empty string. Not reachable on either file this page loads — both
 *     carry `taskInfo` — so this is a difference in the unreachable branch, not
 *     in anything rendered on the pinned data.
 *
 * Two behaviours worth naming that are **not** divergences, because they were
 * measured to be identical and an earlier draft of this list wrongly claimed one
 * of them was a change:
 *
 * - **The historical-fetch-failure fallback.** When the 21-day fetch throws,
 *   `common-ui.js:262-271` writes the error into `#content`, leaves
 *   `isHistoricalMode` false, and `old/crashes.html:1032` then loads the selected
 *   date on top of it — so the error is overwritten by a normal single-day
 *   render and the reader is silently shown a different window than the one
 *   they asked for. Driven in Chrome with the 21-day file 404ing *and the CI
 *   origin blocked at the browser* — without the block, `fetch-utils.js:259`
 *   quietly satisfies the fetch from live CI and the scenario never happens,
 *   which is how the first run of this probe produced a 21-day view dated
 *   2026-07-15..08-04 instead of the pinned 07-14..08-03. With the block, both
 *   pages land on `{status: "1 301 test jobs", rows: 27, button: "Show Last 21
 *   Days", hash: ""}` — byte-identical, including the silent fallback.
 * - **The empty/failed single-day load.** With every data file 404ing, both
 *   pages show `{status: "Error loading data", .no-data: "Failed to fetch",
 *   rows: 0}`.
 *
 * Everything else — the row unit, the 21-day default, the sort keys and their
 * directions, the path collapse, the inline single occurrence, the tooltip and
 * its rounding, the chart wiring, and the `#date=…&q=…` state — is reproduced,
 * and the reasoning for each lives next to the code that does it in
 * `site/drilldown-view.ts`.

/**
 * The daily rate series for a signature, path or test.

 * test IDs to count and then hand them to `countDailyRunsForTests`
 * (`common-charts.js:149`). The shared function is kept, so the test-ID walk
 * stays on the raw file too — porting it to the decoded file would mean
 * `lib/` yielding test IDs that then index back into the raw arrays, which is
 * more coupling than the three call sites are worth.
 *
 * ## Why this walk is not shared with `site/failures.ts`
 *
 * The two are the same shape and not the same code, and unifying them would
 * cost more than it saves. The differences are four, and every one of them is
 * load-bearing:
 *
 * | | crashes | failures |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | value table | `tables.crashSignatures` | `tables.messages` |
 * | field on a status group | `crashSignatureIds` | `messageIds` |
 * | status test | `=== 'CRASH'` (`old/crashes.html:435`) | `startsWith('FAIL')` |
 * | search-filtered variants | none | two (`old/failures.html:966`, `:1013`) |
 *
 * The status test in particular is *not* a parameter: this page matching a bare
 * `'CRASH'` and the other page matching a `FAIL` **prefix** is upstream's rule
 * on each page, `test/crashes-page.test.ts` pins the strict form here and
 * `test/failures-page.test.ts` pins the prefix form there, and a shared walk
 * taking a predicate would be a function whose only body is the loop the two
 * already agree on. The saving would be about 30 lines against two more
 * parameters and a predicate; that is the trade this codebase's rule says not to
 * make.
