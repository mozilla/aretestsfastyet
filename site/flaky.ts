/**
 * `flaky.html` — how flaky the tree is, over time and by folder.
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/query/flakiness.ts` | the classification, the folder rollup, the running average | `test/flakiness.test.ts` |
 * | `site/flaky-view.ts` | the view model — rows, sort, search, colour bands, URL state | `test/flaky-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | this file | the renderer and the interactions | `test/flaky-page.test.ts` |
 *
 * A new page, not a migration: there is no old page to be byte-identical to, so
 * the reasoning below is about what the page *should* do rather than about what
 * an existing one already did.
 *
 * ## The data it reads
 *
 * The same two files as `issues.html`, deliberately not the third, plus one
 * committed sibling:
 *
 * - `{harness}-issues.json` — the 2.8 MB counts-only 21-day aggregate, which is
 *   what the page opens on. Every number here is a count of runs per day, which
 *   is exactly what this page needs.
 * - `{harness}-<date>.json` — one day, when a date is selected.
 * - `{harness}-flaky-backfill.json` — a 21-27 kB committed file holding four
 *   integers per day for the ~250 days before the aggregate's window. It feeds
 *   the two charts at the top and nothing else; see `chartDays` for why the
 *   tiles and the table cannot use it, and `lib/formats/flaky-backfill.ts` for
 *   the merge rule.
 * - **not** `{harness}-issues-with-taskids.json`. That file exists to name the
 *   job behind a failure, and nothing on this page does: a folder row is a
 *   count, not a list of runs. Skipping it saves 15.9 MB per visit.
 *
 * ## Two charts, and what the first one contains
 *
 * Counts on top, percentages below, rather than one chart with two y axes: a
 * dual-axis plot makes the reader work out which series belongs to which scale
 * before they can read either, and the two questions — how many tests are in
 * trouble, and what share of the tree that is — are separate.
 *
 * The counts chart plots flaky and skipped always, and stable **once the window
 * is long enough for its growth to be the point** — `STABLE_CHART_DAYS` holds
 * the measurements. Over the 21-day artifact alone it stays out, which is what
 * it did before the backfill existed.
 *
 * The percentage chart carries the raw flaky rate, its **centred** 7-day mean —
 * so a bump sits over the day that caused it — and the skip rate.
 *
 * Both charts are hidden outright in single-day mode: one day is one point, and
 * an empty plot area reads as a page that failed to load.
 *
 * ## The two things the table can count
 *
 * A row is a folder or a test file, and in both table modes **a test counts
 * once**. The window view classifies a test by the worst state it reached on
 * any day rather than adding one count per day it ran — the latter made a
 * single test worth 21 rows, counted the same test as both flaky and stable,
 * and turned a column headed "Tests" from 4,805 into 100,716. See
 * `FolderOptions.allDays`.

 * Loads the committed history, best-effort.
 *
 * A plain `fetch` of a sibling and not `fetchData`, because the file travels with
 * the page rather than being published by CI — the arrangement `site/index.ts`
 * already uses for `mochitest-stats-backfill.json`.
 *
 * **Best-effort by design**, matching `loadHarness` in `site/index.ts`: a 404 or
 * an unparseable body leaves `backfill` at `null` and the charts show the 21 days
 * they showed before. Both harnesses have a file committed today, so unlike
 * `index.html`'s xpcshell request this is not *expected* to miss — but a page
 * whose charts silently shorten is a far better failure than one that shows an
 * error box over a working table.
 *
 * The response is validated past `ok`: a static server that answers every path
 * with `index.html` would otherwise put an HTML parse error in the console and,
 * worse, a body with the right keys and wrong meaning would merge. So the
 * harness and the four counters are checked before it is used.
