/**
 * `manifests.html`'s **view model**: every decision the page makes, as plain
 * values, with no DOM.
 *
 * ## Why this page does not use `site/drilldown-view.ts`
 *
 * The brief asked for this judgement rather than an assumption either way, so
 * it is written out. The two are **not** the same shape:
 *
 * | | crashes / failures | manifests |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | levels | key → dirPath → test → occurrence, **4** | manifest → job → **chart**, 3 |
 * | what a row *is* | a signature / a message | one **manifest path** |
 * | the middle level | a **directory**, with a collapse rule when it holds one test | one **job name**, no path structure and nothing to collapse |
 * | the leaf | one run, as a **table row** | **not a row at all** — one `<td colspan=5>` holding a per-run Plotly scatter |
 * | ranking | `count` or `tests`, count-like integers | `median` / `mean` **durations**, plus `manifest`, `jobTypes`, `runs` |
 * | what the numbers are | occurrence counts | **duration statistics with an absent case** — a manifest that ran nowhere has no median, and must not read as zero |
 * | the search | one box, drops or rewrites rows | **two boxes**, and the second filters the *sub-rows* of an expanded row as well as the top level |
 * | paging | none; the list is virtualized | **fixed 50 per page**, with Previous/Next |
 * | expansion state | a set of keys | two sets — manifests, and `manifest\|\|\|job` pairs |
 *
 * The decisive one is the leaf. `drilldown-view.ts`'s bottom level is an
 * `Occurrence` that becomes a table row, and this page's bottom level is a
 * chart: there is no per-run row here at all, and `Occurrence` carries
 * `minidump`, a component and a task link that a scatter point does not want.
 * Serving both would mean a `SubRow` member that renders as a `colspan` cell,
 * a `GroupRow` gaining a nullable `median`, a nullable `mean` and an
 * `allSkipped` flag, an always-single synthetic `PathNode` level, and a second
 * search string threaded through `filterGroupsByMatch`. That is the "three new
 * booleans" signal the brief names, and `site/errors-view.ts` declined for
 * less.
 *
 * What *is* reused: `site/drilldown-render.ts`'s DOM primitives (`el`,
 * `noData`) and its `declare global` block for the shared scripts — genuinely
 * page-independent, and the escaping question is answered once at `el()`.
 *
 * ## Why the page's own aggregation, and not `lib/query/manifest-stats.ts`
 *
 * `computeManifestStats` answers this question for the CLI and is the
 * comparison target in `test/manifests-parity.test.ts`. The page does **not**
 * call it, and the reason is a measured disagreement rather than a preference:
 *
 * - **The median rule differs, on half the corpus.** The page takes the
 *   **upper** middle element (`manifests.html:429`, `:455`:
 *   `sorted[Math.floor(n / 2)]`); `summarize` takes the nearest-rank quantile
 *   (`lib/query/manifest-stats.ts:302-305`: `ceil(0.5n) - 1`), which is the
 *   **lower** middle. They agree on every odd-length sample and differ on every
 *   even-length one. Measured on the pinned 2026-08-04 file: the two rules give
 *   a different median on **3,122 of 6,227 manifests**, and on `[10 … 100]`
 *   they give 60 and 50. `test/step5-query.test.ts:401` pins the CLI's rule
 *   deliberately, so this is two intended rules, not a bug in one of them.
 * - **`mean` exists here and nowhere in `lib/`.** `DurationStats` has `min`,
 *   `median`, `p95`, `max` and `total` and no mean; this page's fifth column is
 *   a mean, and adding one to `DurationStats` for a field only this page reads
 *   is the wrong direction.
 * - **The page has no `p95`, `max`, `total`, `os` or `platforms`,** and pooling
 *   `platforms` per manifest costs a `parseJobName` per configuration —
 *   173,875 pairs on the pinned file — for a column that does not exist here.
 * - **The row unit differs at the job level.** The page groups sub-rows by
 *   `runs.jobNameIds` (`manifests.html:376`, `:382`) and so does
 *   `computeManifestStats`; both use the chunk-stripped name, so this one
 *   agrees — recorded because it is the trap `FORMATS.md` measures at 360,373
 *   of 433,836 runs, and agreement here is a fact worth pinning rather than
 *   assuming.
 *
 * So the seam is the one `PARITY.md` §5 wants: two implementations of the same
 * question, compared against each other, rather than one wrapping the other
 * and making the comparison vacuous. What *is* shared is the rule that matters
 * most — the all-zero-durations rule — and the parity test asserts that both
 * sides classify the identical set of pairs as skipped.
 *
 * ## The all-zero-durations rule, and where it changes a number
 *
 * A (manifest, job) pair whose durations are **all** zero was skipped there,
 * not run instantly (`manifests.html:416`). `every`, not `any`. Such a pair is
 * excluded from `totalRuns` (`:441`), from the pooled runtimes (`:442`) and
 * from `totalJobs` (`:461`) — so a manifest's Runs column counts runs on
 * configs where it *ran*, and its Job Types column counts configs where it
 * ran. Measured on the pinned 2026-08-04 file: 78,957 of 494,380 runs are zero
 * (16.0%), and 26,932 of 173,875 (manifest, job) pairs are skipped.
 *
 * A manifest skipped on *every* job it appears on has no runtime at all —
 * `durations` is `null` here and `SKIP` on the page — and there are **302** of
 * them. They must sort **last**, not first; see `DEFAULT_SORT` for the bug that
 * fell out of getting that wrong.
 *
 * ## This file must stay DOM-free
 *
 * Enforced the same way as `site/errors-view.ts`: `test/manifests-view.test.ts`
 * imports it, the root `tsconfig.json` compiles `test/**`, and the root project
 * has no DOM lib. A `document` reach fails `npm run typecheck`.

 *
 * Deliberately decoupled from the table: these are `data.manifests.length`,
 * `data.jobNames.length` and `data.runs.durations.length`, so they describe the
 * whole corpus and do not move when a search narrows the table to one row.
 * Reproduced exactly, because "how big is the corpus" is a different question
 * from "what am I looking at" and the page answers both.
 *
 * Two of the three are **not** what the table would say even unfiltered.
 * Measured on the pinned 2026-08-04 file:
 *
 * | card | shows | the table's own count |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Total Manifests | 6,227 | 6,227 — every manifest in the table has at least one run |
 * | Total Jobs | **4,165** | **859** distinct job names actually appear on a run |
 * | Total Runs | **494,380** | **415,445** on pairs that ran — the card counts the 78,957 skipped ones too |
 *
 * So two of the three cards do not describe the table. Total Jobs is the length
 * of the `jobNames` **string table**, and that table is shared with
 * `tasks.jobName`, which keeps the chunk suffix — 4,165 entries of which only
 * 859 are reachable as a run's chunk-stripped configuration. Total Runs
 * includes runs every Runs cell excludes.
 *
 * Both are upstream's meaning and both are kept. Changing them would be a
 * different page rather than a migration of this one, and the gap is recorded
 * here so the next reader does not have to rediscover that the card and the
 * column disagree by design. Divergence 11 records the one thing this does say
 * on the page.

 * path segment rather than part of the id. Measured on the pinned 2026-08-04
 * file: **231 of 11,378** tasks. (`FORMATS.md` records 216 of 9,543 against an
 * earlier file; the share is stable, the counts are per-file.) A missing suffix
 * means run `0`.
 *
 * ## Why this delegates to `parseTaskId` rather than splitting on `.`
 *
 * This used to be `taskId.split('.')` with an unvalidated `parts[1]`, which is
 * a *different function* from `lib/formats/tables.ts`'s `parseTaskId` on two
 * inputs: `abc.1.2` gives retry `1` here and `2` there (last dot, not first),
 * and `abc.def` gives retry `def` here and `0` there. Both feed the same
 * Taskcluster `/runs/<n>/` URLs, so the two could not both be right.
 *
 * Neither input occurs. Across the published `manifests.json` (11,378 task ids)
 * and both manifests fixtures (1,393 more), **0 ids carry more than one dot and
 * 0 have a non-numeric suffix** — the only suffixes present are `1`, `2` and
 * `3`. Running the two implementations over all 12,771 gives 0 disagreements.
 * So this is unified on the validated one on that measurement, not on a
 * guess, and the collision is unreachable *in this data* rather than
 * impossible.
 *
 * The string-valued `retryId` is kept because it is interpolated straight into
 * a URL; `parseTaskId` returns a number and both render identically.
