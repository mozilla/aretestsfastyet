/**
 * `failures.html`, migrated onto `lib/`.
 *
 * Migrated as **one job** with `crashes.html` — see `site/crashes.ts` for the
 * file split and why the two were done together. This file is the failures half:
 * this page's `PageSpec`, its hooks, its chart walks and its URL rule.
 *
 * The state, the four-level expansion machine, the delegated click handler,
 * `loadSelectedDate`, the historical toggle and `start()` are
 * `site/drilldown-controller.ts`, which this page and the crashes page share. A
 * normalized diff had put the two controllers at 82% identical. **What was
 * deliberately left duplicated** — `applyUrlState`, and the chart walk — is
 * marked as such at each site, with the reason.
 *
 * ## What the migration removes
 *
 * **The inline decoding of the status-group shapes.** `processFailureData`
 * (`failures.html:207-360`) is 150 lines branching on `isBucketedFormat`, which
 * covers two of the five shapes `FORMATS.md` documents.
 * `lib/formats/status-entries.ts` resolves all five and throws on a sixth.
 *
 * `common-test-data.js` is **not** loaded, and was not loaded before either —
 * `grep -c common-test-data failures.html` is 0. See `site/crashes.ts` for the
 * full note; the summary is that this page never had the tag, so the brief's
 * requirement is satisfied with nothing removed.
 *
 * The six shared scripts stay, loaded by name. `common-links.js` is doing real
 * work on this page in particular: `getBugzillaUrl` and `getBugButton` build the
 * 🐛 button, and `linkifyFailureMessage`'s Searchfox rule is reproduced as a
 * decision in `site/failures-view.ts` rather than called, because it returns
 * markup.
 *
 * ## Declared divergences from `failures.html`
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §4: byte-identical is the default and every exception is declared.
 * **This list is the whole set** — one enumerated list, no prose carrying an
 * extra entry.
 *
 *  1. **Inline handler attributes become `addEventListener`.** Upstream emits
 *     `onclick="sortBy('tests')"`, `onclick="sortBy('count')"`,
 *     `onclick="window.open('…', '_blank')"` on every single-failure row, and
 *     `onclick="event.stopPropagation();"` on every link and every 🐛 button, as
 *     **attributes**. This page attaches the same handlers and emits none of its
 *     own. Measured in Chrome on the pinned snapshot at first paint: **old 2,
 *     new 0**, rising as rows expand.
 *
 *     One `onclick` does survive in the new page's DOM and it is not this
 *     page's: the 🐛 button's markup comes from `getBugButton`
 *     (`common-links.js:216`), a shared script this migration keeps, and it
 *     writes `onclick="event.stopPropagation();"` into the string it returns.
 *     Its count therefore tracks the number of bug buttons rather than the
 *     number of rows.
 *
 *  2. **`data-message` is gone; rows are held in a `Map` — and this fixes a
 *     live bug.** Upstream writes `data-message="${escapeAttr(msg)}"` and finds
 *     a row again with `querySelector('[data-message="' + escapeAttr(msg) +
 *     '"]')` (`:670`, `:683`). The round-trip does not survive a quote:
 *     `escapeAttr` writes `&quot;`, the HTML parser decodes it back to `"` in
 *     the attribute value, and the CSS selector then looks for the literal text
 *     `&quot;`.
 *
 *     **Measured in Chrome on the pinned snapshot: 1,848 of the 2,841 rows
 *     (65%) cannot find themselves.** And it is live: expanding
 *     `Unexpected exception TypeError: can't access property "resumed", …`
 *     gives it 2 sub-rows, and clicking a column header to re-sort leaves that
 *     row with the `expanded` class, `expandedMessage` still pointing at it, and
 *     **0 sub-rows** — a highlighted row with nothing under it that then needs
 *     two clicks to open. A quote-free control row is unaffected by the same
 *     steps.
 *
 *     Here the row elements live in a `Map` keyed by the raw message, so the
 *     round-trip does not exist. **A DOM diff sees one absent attribute per
 *     row; a reader sees a row that reopens.**
 *
 *  3. **The total row's "Tests" number still overcounts.** It sums each row's
 *     test count, so a test failing with several messages counts once per
 *     message. Measured on the pinned snapshot: the row shows **7,976** where
 *     **3,793** distinct tests failed, a 2.10× overcount. **Reproduced
 *     unchanged**, for the reason given in `totalsOf`: it is the sum of the
 *     column above it and a reader checks it by adding the rows up.
 *
 *  4. **The search still rewrites the counts on the rows.** Reproduced exactly,
 *     including the part that surprises: a row whose *message* does not match
 *     shows a **smaller count under a search than without one**, because it is
 *     recomputed from only the tests that matched. `crashes.html` does the
 *     opposite — it leaves the numbers alone and drops whole rows — and the
 *     difference between the two pages is upstream's, not this migration's.
 *
 *  5. **A stale search box is now cleared on hashchange.** `failures.html:1100`
 *     is `if (document.activeElement !== searchBox && state.q)`, so a hash with
 *     no `q` never *clears* the box: navigating from `#q=netwerk` to
 *     `#date=2026-08-04` leaves `netwerk` in the box and the list filtered by a
 *     term the URL no longer names, and the next hash write puts `q=netwerk`
 *     back. **This is the one behaviour change on this list.**
 *
 *     Why fixed here and not left alone: the alternative is a page whose
 *     displayed state contradicts its own URL, which breaks the property
 *     `PARITY.md` §4 names explicitly — "a shared link must produce the same
 *     view on both". A link with no `q` must not produce a filtered list. The
 *     new page writes `state.q ?? ''`, so an absent `q` clears the box, and the
 *     focus guard is kept unchanged so typing is never interrupted.
 *
 *     `crashes.html:989` has the identical bug. It is **not** fixed there — see
 *     that file's list — because the crashes page's search only hides rows,
 *     while this page's search rewrites every number on screen, so the stale
 *     state is far more misleading here. Fixing one and not the other is a
 *     deliberate asymmetry rather than an oversight, and it is stated on both
 *     lists so a reviewer sees it from either side.
 *
 *  6. **A job name the file cannot resolve renders as empty, not `"undefined"`.**
 *     Same as `crashes.html`'s entry 6, and equally unreachable on the files
 *     this page loads.
 *
 *  7. **The message's Searchfox link is built from parts.**
 *     `linkifyFailureMessage` (`common-ui.js:22`) returns a string of HTML that
 *     the page interpolates; here `messageLink()` returns the split point and
 *     the renderer builds an anchor and a text node. The rendered text and the
 *     href are identical — `test/failures-view.test.ts` asserts the split
 *     against the shared function's own regex — and the difference a DOM diff
 *     sees is the absent `onclick` on the anchor, which is entry 1.
 *
 * Everything else — the row unit including the rankable `(no failure message)`
 * row, the `FAIL*` prefix universe, the 21-day default, the sort keys, the path
 * collapse, the bug button's `Product :: Component` guard, the tooltip and its
 * rounding, the four chart variants including the two search-filtered ones, and
 * the `#date=…&q=…` state — is reproduced.
