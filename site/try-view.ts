/**
 * `try.html`'s **view model**: one Try push reduced to exactly what the page
 * draws, with no DOM in sight.
 *
 * The third and last of the three migrations `PARITY.md` §3 sequences, and the
 * one it deliberately put last. It follows the boundary the first two settled:
 *
 * > **`lib/` holds data and derivations. The page directory holds the view
 * > model — including anything that names an element id, a CSS class or a
 * > glyph.**
 *
 * ## What came from `lib/`
 *
 * | from | replaces | why it is `lib/`'s |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `computeConfigStats` (`lib/query/config-stats.ts`) | `common-test-data.js:121` | the recent-window sizing, shared with `fx-tests try` |
 * | `computeTestStats` (`lib/query/test-stats.ts`) | `common-test-data.js:267` | per-status run totals |
 * | `stripChunkSuffix` (`lib/model/job-name.ts`) | `common-test-data.js:80` | the config identity rule |
 * | `findTestByPath` / `decodeBucket` (`lib/formats/`) | `findTest`, ad-hoc indexing | the file format |
 * | `bucketIndexForPath` (`lib/formats/buckets.ts`) | `getChunkIndex` | the bucket hash |
 * | `detectHarness` (`lib/model/harness.ts`) | `common-test-data.js:9` | which file a test lives in |
 * | `classifyStatus` (`lib/model/status.ts`) | inline prefix tests | status classification |
 *
 * The page no longer loads `common-test-data.js`, which was the point of the
 * exercise: all six of the functions try.html reached into it for now have a
 * typed, tested `lib/` equivalent, and one of them (`computeConfigStats`) is
 * the one `PLAN.md` §3 named as "should be moved, not rewritten".
 *
 * ## What stayed here, and why it is not `lib/`'s
 *
 * **The push's own aggregation** (`aggregateFailures`, below). It looks like a
 * data derivation and it very nearly is one — `cli/commands/try.ts` has its own
 * copy under the same name. They are deliberately *not* unified, and the reason
 * is the one thing this page must not get wrong:
 *
 * `try.html`'s row unit is **one test path, aggregated across the push**, ranked
 * by **failing executions** (`test.instances.length`, `try.html:1749`), and its
 * two tables are split by whether *every* instance was intermittent
 * (`try.html:1765`). `fx-tests try`'s row unit is the same test path but its
 * sections are split on `everyRunFailed` — a per-configuration fact — and it
 * carries central history on each row. Those are two different questions asked
 * of the same timings, and `PARITY.md` §5 exists precisely to compare them
 * rather than to collapse them. Unifying the aggregation would delete the thing
 * being compared.
 *
 * **Everything naming a badge, a glyph or a CSS class.** `MITTEN`, the
 * `status-FAIL` / `platform-linux` / `build-opt` class suffixes, the
 * `count-cell high|medium|low` thresholds, the `flaky` / `flaky-msg` /
 * `flaky-few-runs` classes, and the tooltip prose. The class name is the channel
 * the old page used to express a decision, and reproducing the name is what
 * keeps `shared.css` unchanged.
 *
 * **`pickHeadlineRate` and `flakinessTooltip`.** These decide what one 45px
 * table cell says, and the tooltip is written to be read in a proportional font
 * at a specific width (`try.html:2813`). `fx-tests try` answers the same
 * question with three annotated lines per row and no width limit. Page-local.
 *
 * ## This file must stay DOM-free
 *
 * `tsconfig.site.json` gives `site/` the DOM lib, so that is a discipline rather
 * than something the compiler enforces here — but it *is* enforced indirectly:
 * `test/try-view.test.ts` imports this module, the root project compiles
 * `test/**`, and the root project has no DOM. A `document` reach fails
 * `npm run typecheck` on the root project.

 *
 * 1. **The harness reran it in-job and it passed.** The strongest signal there
 *    is — the same binary, the same machine, the same job, a different outcome.
 *    This is the *within-job* rerun (`isRetry`), not the job-level `retryId`.
 * 2. **Another run of the same job name succeeded entirely.** If
 *    `test-linux2404-64/opt-xpcshell-3` passed once and failed once, whatever
 *    failed in it was not deterministic.
 * 3. **Another run of the same job name failed on *different* tests.** Two runs
 *    of one config that fail on disjoint test sets are both flaky runs; a test
 *    absent from one of the failure sets did not fail there.
 *
 * ## The seeding, and why it is load-bearing
 *
 * `failsByJobAndRun` is seeded with **every processed job** before any timing is
 * read (`try.html:1380`), so a run whose profile yielded no parseable test-level
 * failure — a harness crash, a killed job — still counts as a separate run of
 * that job name with an empty failure set. Without the seeding, case 3 could
 * never see it, and a test that failed in one run of a two-run config where the
 * other run crashed the harness would read as permanent.
 *
 * Mutating in place rather than returning is upstream's shape and is kept: the
 * `intermittent` flag is read off the timing objects by four later passes, and
 * threading a parallel map through all of them would be a bigger change than
 * the migration is making.

 * per configuration would produce the same *numbers* and answer a different
 * question.
 *
 * ## The default sort, and what its direction actually decides
 *
 * `tests.sort((a, b) => b.instances.length - a.instances.length)`
 * (`try.html:1588`) — failing executions, descending.
 *
 * **It is not the table's order.** `renderTable` re-sorts through `sortTests`
 * with the same key by default (`currentSort = { column: 'count', ascending:
 * false }`, `try.html:744`), and `Array.prototype.sort` has been required to be
 * stable since ES2019, so tie members keep whatever relative order they had
 * *going in*. Both directions of this pre-sort leave tie members in
 * `testMap.values()` insertion order — a descending pre-sort does not permute
 * within a tie group and neither does an ascending one — so the re-sort erases
 * the direction entirely. Measured on `try-7d16bff81bb1` (28 tests, five tie
 * groups sized 3/6/3/5/8): flipping this comparator to ascending changes **0 of
 * 28** positions in the default table.
 *
 * **What it does decide is the flakiness fetch order**, and that is observable.
 * `site/try.ts` passes this array straight to `fetchFlakinessData`, which
 * numbers it into `testOrder` and hands that to `groupRequestsByChunk` — so the
 * pre-sort's direction is the priority the bucket files are fetched in. Same
 * fixture: descending fetches `mochitest-04` first, ascending fetches
 * `mochitest-1e` first, and the full 27-file sequence is exactly reversed.
 * Descending is the one that fills the visible top of the table first, which is
 * the whole point of ordering the fetches at all; ascending would fill it last.
 * `test/try-view.test.ts` asserts the fetch order, not the table order, because
 * only the former can fail.
 *
 * ## `commonMessage`, and the crash fallback
 *
 * The inline message under a test path appears only when **every** instance
 * that recorded a message recorded the *same* one (`try.html:1538`) — a summary
 * line that showed one of several different messages would be worse than none.
 * Note the asymmetry the crash fallback introduces (`:1543`): the message rule
 * ignores instances with no message, while the signature rule requires
 * `crashSigs.length === entry.instances.length`, so one crash without a
 * signature suppresses the line. Preserved as written.

 * Sorts the tests for display. `try.html:1747`.
 *
 * Four keys, and two of them need stating:
 *
 * - **`count` is `instances.length`** — failing executions. Ranking on distinct
 *   job runs instead produces the same set in a different order, which is the
 *   one defect class `PARITY.md` §1 says a value diff cannot catch.
 * - **`status` sorts on the alphabetised, comma-joined status set**, so
 *   `CRASH,FAIL` sorts before `FAIL` and before `TIMEOUT`. Not a severity order
 *   — it groups rows that failed the same *way*, which is what the column is
 *   for.
 *
 * A test with no flakiness data yet sorts as `-1` (`try.html:1753`), below every
 * real rate including 0%. The data arrives asynchronously per bucket file, so
 * during loading the unresolved rows collect at the bottom of a descending sort
 * and the table visibly fills in from the top.
 *
 * ## Ties
 *
 * **No tiebreak. Equal keys keep their input order**, which is
 * `aggregateFailures`'s `testMap` insertion order — and that is
 * `allTimings` order, which is *not deterministic*. This is upstream's
 * behaviour, faithfully, and it is worth writing down rather than leaving to
 * the reader because it is the difference between "the two pages disagree" and
 * "the page disagrees with itself".
 *
 * The mechanism, confirmed in code: `allTimings.push(...timings)`
 * (`try.html:1117`, transliterated at `site/try.ts:623`) appends each profile
 * worker's results **in worker-completion order**. Eight workers parse profiles
 * fetched 64 at a time, so the append order is a network and scheduler race.
 * Pinning the data does not fix it — the fetches are still concurrent.
 *
 * Measured in Chrome, both pages reloaded four times each against one pinned
 * snapshot, with every unpinned request failing hard (0 reached the network):
 *
 * - `09028ab93fe1` (71 rows): **stable**. 0 of 71 positions differ, old against
 *   itself, new against itself, and old against new. A push this size finishes
 *   its fetches in a consistent order — but see below, this is luck, not a
 *   guarantee.
 * - `717fc67feaa071` (431 rows): the old page disagrees **with itself** by
 *   112, 163 and 166 of 431 positions across three reloads. The new page
 *   disagrees with itself by 88-116. Old-against-new spans 104-181 — the same
 *   magnitude, so the two pages are indistinguishable from one page reloaded.
 * - **Zero unequal-count differences in any of the twelve comparisons.** Every
 *   differing index was a tie. That is the assertion worth keeping: the order
 *   is unstable *only* where the sort key does not decide it.
 *
 * A harness that diffs raw row order on a large push is therefore measuring the
 * network, not the code, and will report ~30% of rows as defects at random.
 * Normalising ties before diffing is not papering over a difference; it is the
 * only way to see one.
 *
 * So a parity harness must normalise ties before diffing; a diff that does not
 * is measuring the network. The CLI takes the other route and **breaks ties on
 * the path** (`cli/commands/try.ts:1027-1036`) precisely because output that is
 * diffed and pasted into bugs cannot be non-deterministic. `PARITY.md` §5
 * already declares that as a permitted divergence. This function does *not*
 * adopt the CLI's tiebreak: it would be a real ordering change against the page
 * it is migrating, and this file's contract is the page.

 * its full history when it never reached `MIN_RECENT_RUNS` there.
 *
 * ## Why the argmax is on a lower confidence bound
 *
 * `score = rate - 100 / sqrt(runs)` (`try.html:2776`). Comparing raw rates lets
 * a config with a hundred runs that happened to land a bit higher beat one with
 * a few hundred, and the tooltip then leads with the noisier number. The
 * penalty is the width of a rough interval: at 100 runs it is 10 points, at
 * 10,000 it is 1. A config with **zero** runs scores 0 rather than `-Infinity`,
 * which is upstream's `r.runs > 0 ? … : 0` and matters because a 0-run config
 * would otherwise be preferred over any config with a genuinely negative score
 * (a low rate over few runs).
 *
 * ## The fallback, and what it changes
 *
 * `if (!best || best.rate === 0)` returns `scope: 'overall'` — the test's whole
 * failure rate across every platform. So a **0% winner is discarded**: when no
 * config in this push's set shows the same failure at all, the column stops
 * answering "does this exact failure pre-exist" and answers "how flaky is this
 * test in general" instead. The tooltip says which, and `hasMatchingMessage`
 * drives the class that colours it.
 *
 * The rate counts failures with the **same message** as the push, which is what
 * makes a failure pre-existing. A test failing often for an unrelated reason
 * says nothing about the failure being triaged, so the all-failure rate is
 * relegated to the tooltip's last line.
