/**
 * `test.html`'s **view model**: one test's bucket file reduced to exactly what
 * the page draws, with no DOM in sight.
 *
 * The second of the three migrations `PARITY.md` §3 sequences, following the
 * boundary `site/crash-view.ts` settled:
 *
 * > **`lib/` holds data and derivations. The page directory holds the view
 * > model — including anything that names an element id, a CSS class or a
 * > glyph.**
 *
 * Applying that test here draws the line in a specific and slightly surprising
 * place, so it is worth stating what went which way.
 *
 * ## What came from `lib/`, unchanged
 *
 * | from | replaces | verified against the old page |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `computeTestStats` (`lib/query/test-stats.ts`) | `common-test-data.js:267` | 775 tests across 4 real bucket files, every field equal |
 * | `coverageOf` (`lib/query/coverage.ts`) | `calculateJobNameBreakdown` (`old/test.html:2607`) | same 775 tests, every job name and count equal |
 * | `bucketIndexForPath` (`lib/formats/buckets.ts`) | `getChunkIndex` (`common-test-data.js:26`) | same hash, `\| 0` and all |
 * | `decoded.findTest` (`lib/formats/tables.ts`) | `findTest` (`common-test-data.js:53`) | same linear path join |
 * | `detectHarness` (`lib/model/harness.ts`) | `common-test-data.js:9` | moved out of `cli/options.ts`; see that module |
 * | `classifyStatus`, `skipReason`, `displaySkipMessage` | six inline copies | — |
 *
 * The page no longer loads `common-test-data.js` at all, which was the point.
 *
 * ## What stayed here, and why it is not `lib/`'s
 *
 * **`extractVariant` / `displayVariant` / `displayPlatform` and the collapse
 * machinery.** This is the largest thing in this file and the easiest to
 * mistake for a data derivation. It is not: it decides *how many rows and
 * columns the table has*. `computeDisplayMappings` collapses `X-swr` into `X`
 * only when their per-platform outcome signatures match, and merges the 32- and
 * 64-bit columns only when no variant distinguishes them — both are judgements
 * about what a reader should see side by side, made from the data but
 * answerable only in terms of a table. `lib/query/coverage.ts` deliberately has
 * no such concept: it reports one row per configuration and says so.
 *
 * The test from `crash-view.ts` — *would a non-page consumer want this, and
 * does it name anything about the UI?* — comes out the same way it did there.
 * `fx-tests test --coverage` prints configurations, not a variant × platform
 * pivot, and moving this to `lib/` would be shipping a reuse nothing has asked
 * for.
 *
 * **Everything naming a badge, a cell key or a glyph.** `cellKey()` builds
 * `"variant|platform"`, which is the string the DOM carries in `data-variant`
 * and `data-platform` and which every interaction is keyed on. The badge kinds
 * are `fail`/`crash`/`timeout`/`pass`/`skip`, which are CSS class suffixes.
 * Both are here for the reason `frameRows()`'s `crashed` class was: the class
 * name is the channel the old page used to express a behavioural decision, and
 * reproducing the name is what keeps the stylesheet unchanged.
 *
 * ## Why the view model exists at all
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §2. A page that builds strings of HTML out of a parsed JSON file
 * has no seam to compare against; the only way to ask what it decided is to
 * read the pixels back. Splitting the decisions from the drawing means the job
 * table's row order, the badge percentages, the issue list and its counts are
 * all plain values a node test can assert on, and `site/test.ts` becomes a
 * transliteration.
 *
 * It matters more here than it did for the crash viewer, because this page's
 * interactions *recompute* the view: selecting two cells and three days
 * re-derives every badge, every issue count and the runtime panel. Those
 * recomputations are functions in this file taking a selection and returning
 * values, so the filtered states are testable without driving a browser.
 *
 * ## This file must stay DOM-free
 *
 * `tsconfig.site.json` gives `site/` the DOM lib, so that is a discipline
 * rather than something the compiler enforces here — but it *is* enforced
 * indirectly: `test/test-view.test.ts` imports this module, the root project
 * compiles `test/**`, and the root project has no DOM. A `document` reach fails
 * `npm run typecheck` on the root project.

/**
 * `coverageOf`'s rows, put back into the order the page's own walk produced
 * them.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and how it was found
 *
 * `coverageOf` sorts its output by descending run count and then by job name
 * (`lib/query/coverage.ts:292`), which is right for a CLI table. The page does
 * not sort at all: `calculateJobNameBreakdown` returns a plain object and
 * `Object.entries` yields insertion order, which is the order the status-group
 * walk first saw each job name.
 *
 * That difference is invisible until two variants **tie** in the row sort, and
 * then it decides which comes first — because `Array.prototype.sort` is stable,
 * so a tie preserves the input order and the input order is this one.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical. The browser diff on
 * `dom/media/test/test_playback.html` reported exactly this and nothing else:
 *
 * ```
 * row 14  OLD ccov-mochitest-media-nogpu   NEW ccov-mochitest-media
 * row 15  OLD ccov-mochitest-media         NEW ccov-mochitest-media-nogpu
 * ```
 *
 * Both variants have 51 runs and the prefix `ccov`, so both levels of the sort
 * tie and the order falls through to insertion. `coverageOf` had emitted them
 * alphabetically; the page's walk had seen `-nogpu` first.
 *
 * ## Why the order is recovered here rather than changed in `lib/`
 *
 * `coverageOf`'s sort is a documented property its CLI caller relies on, and
 * the page needs the *unsorted* order — so the two want different things from
 * the same query and neither is wrong. Recovering the order costs one pass over
 * the entries and keeps the divergence where it belongs: in the page, whose
 * row order this is.
 *
 * A first pass over `runsOfTest` yields the job names in walk order; the rows
 * are then emitted in that order.
 *
 * ## Why the order matters, measured
 *
 * `Array.prototype.sort` is stable, so the input order decides every tie in
 * `buildJobTable`'s two-level key — and ties are common, not exotic. Over the
 * 1,674 tests in the pinned snapshot plus both checked-in fixtures: **492
 * tests have at least one tied pair** (797 pairs in total), and on **186 of
 * them the resulting row order actually differs** between this walk order and
 * `coverageOf`'s own order. One of the 186 is in `mochitest-00.json`, so
 * `test/test-view.test.ts` pins it against real data.
 *
 * (An earlier review recorded "0 ties" here and concluded the pre-sort was
 * unreachable. That measurement was wrong; the numbers above replace it.)
 *
 * ## The trailing append, and why it is unreachable
 *
 * Any row whose job name the walk never produced is appended in `coverageOf`'s
 * order. **Measured unreachable: 0 configs over those same 1,674 tests.** That
 * is structural rather than lucky, and the reason is worth stating because it
 * is the only thing that could change it:
 *
 *  - Both sides iterate the same `file.runsOfTest(testId)`, and `coverageOf`
 *    creates a row only from an entry it yields — it has no other source
 *    ("nothing is added from outside the test's runs", `lib/query/coverage.ts`).
 *  - Both resolve an entry to job names the same way: `entry.jobName` when the
 *    shape names a job, otherwise `jobNameOfTaskIndex` per task.
 *  - So the walk's name set is a superset of `coverageOf`'s, except for the two
 *    places they differ, and neither can add a name:
 *      1. `coverageOf` keys rows by `stripChunkSuffix(jobName)` while the walk
 *         looks up the raw name. On the bucket family that is an identity —
 *         the generator already strips the chunk suffix into a parallel array
 *         (`lib/formats/buckets.ts`), and `stripChunkSuffix` changes **0 of
 *         the 2,987** `tables.jobNames` entries across the snapshot and the
 *         fixtures. On a family that did carry suffixes this loop is exactly
 *         what would stop a row from being dropped.
 *      2. The walk skips `run-if` skips before taking a name. That can only
 *         make the walk see *fewer* names, and it cannot orphan a row: a
 *         config known **only** from a `run-if` skip gets no row from
 *         `coverageOf` on this family either, because the 21-day aggregates
 *         drop those entries upstream (`FORMATS.md`).
 *
 * It is kept rather than deleted because appending beats dropping if any of
 * those three facts stops holding, and each is a property of the data format
 * rather than of this function.

 *
 * The fail, crash and timeout badges all carry the *same* text, listing every
 * outcome the cell saw (`old/test.html:2765`). Upstream builds it once and
 * interpolates it into each; reproduced, because hovering the CRASH badge to
 * be told only about crashes would hide that the cell also failed 40 times.

 * readable together.
 *

 * carry no `messageIds` at all — `lib/formats/status-entries.ts` says so, and
