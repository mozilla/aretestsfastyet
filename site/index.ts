/**
 * `index.html`, migrated onto `lib/` — the site's landing page.
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/formats/stats.ts` | the file format, shared with the CLI | `test/formats.test.ts` |
 * | `lib/query/summary.ts` | the CLI's 7-day topline over the same file | `test/query.test.ts` |
 * | `site/index-view.ts` | this page's windows, merge, rows and traces | `test/index-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | this file | the renderer, the lazy charts and the interactions | `test/index-page.test.ts` + the browser run |
 * | — | the page against `fx-tests summary` | `test/index-parity.test.ts` |
 *
 * ## `lib/query/summary.ts` is imported, and it does **not** drive the table
 *
 * The brief's instruction was to use it, and this file does — but not where a
 * reader would first expect, so the judgement is stated here rather than left
 * to be inferred from the imports.
 *
 * `computeSummary` computes a 7-day window with a prior-period comparison. The
 * page's table is also 7 days, and **two of its four rates are computed
 * differently** (divergences 1 and 2 below), so rendering the table from
 * `computeSummary` would change two of the eight numbers a visitor sees on the
 * landing page. That is a product decision, not a migration's to make, so the
 * table keeps the page's arithmetic in `site/index-view.ts` and
 * `test/index-parity.test.ts` asserts the two differences — and asserts the
 * other two rates agree exactly, so a future drift in *those* is a failure.
 *
 * Where `computeSummary` **is** used is the thing the page was missing: the
 * prior-period comparison. The file has 199 dates of history and the table
 * showed one week of it with nothing to compare against. Each harness row now
 * carries the change against the prior 7 days, from the shared query, as a
 * `title` tooltip — see divergence 6, which is the one deliberate product
 * change on this list.
 *
 * ## The three time windows are now labelled on the page
 *
 * The single most confusing property of the original, and it was invisible: the
 * summary table is 7 days (`old/index.html:524`), the four charts are the *entire*
 * file unsliced (`:632-640`, `:649-668`, `:677-686`, `:695-723`), and the
 * summary's own links go to a 21-day view (`:487`). Measured on the pinned
 * files, the table covers **7** dates and the charts cover **199** (xpcshell)
 * and **198** (mochitest) — a 28-fold difference with nothing on screen saying
 * so.
 *
 * `site/index-view.ts`'s header carries the table. What this file does about it
 * is divergence 5: each chart's existing `.info-text` gains the span it
 * actually covers, read from the data rather than written down.
 *
 * ## Declared divergences from `index.html`
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §4: byte-identical is the default and every exception is
 * declared. **This list is the whole set.** One enumerated list; no prose
 * elsewhere carrying a further entry.
 *
 *  1. **The Flaky Job Failures column divides by a corrected denominator.** A
 *     bug fix, and the largest number on this page that changes.
 *
 *     Upstream computes `(failedJobs − invalidJobs) / processedJobCount`
 *     (`old/index.html:476`, `:479`), removing the invalid jobs from the numerator
 *     while also leaving them out of the denominator. The generator says the
 *     numerator never contained them: `failedJobs` is counted over every
 *     non-ignored job of the day (`fetch-test-data.js:1821`), and
 *     `processedJobCount` and `invalidJobs` are the two disjoint branches that
 *     population splits into (`:267-282`). So the numerator was being reduced
 *     by a set it did not contain, and divided by a population short of its
 *     own. `site/index-view.ts`'s `summaryRow` carries the full derivation.
 *
 *     Both this page and `lib/query/summary.ts` now compute
 *     `failedJobs / (processedJobCount + invalidJobs)` — the CLI's old form
 *     had the right numerator and the same short denominator. Measured on the
 *     pinned files, last 7 dates:
 *
 *     | | page before | CLI before | both now |
 *     | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | xpcshell | 11.83% (883 / 7,464) | 12.30% (918 / 7,464) | **12.24%** (918 / 7,499) |
 *     | mochitest | 2.66% (4,494 / 169,142) | 2.99% (5,049 / 169,142) | **2.98%** (5,049 / 169,697) |
 *
 *     The cell's second line moves with the rate — it now reads
 *     `918 / 7,499`, the two numbers the percentage is actually made of.
 *
 *     Upstream's `// Only test-related failures` comment (`:476`) is **not**
 *     carried across: it names an intent the arithmetic never achieved. The
 *     `.info-text` under the *chart* (`:256`) still says "excludes invalid
 *     jobs" and that remains accurate — the chart keeps upstream's
 *     `failedJobs − invalidJobs` series, which this change does not touch.
 *
 *     This also retires the negative-rate hazard the port previously measured
 *     and pinned. With no subtraction in the numerator, no combination of
 *     counters produces a negative percentage.
 *
 *     A **flavor** row is not the same expression and deliberately so: a flavor
 *     carries no `invalidJobs` field at all (`fetch-test-data.js:2833-2838`)
 *     and its `processedJobCount` is `jc.total`, the raw non-ignored job count
 *     for that flavor (`:2769`), which is already the population its
 *     `failedJobs` was drawn from. See `summaryRow`.
 *
 *  2. **The Skip Rate column is unchanged, and the CLI was corrected to
 *     match.** Listed because a reader diffing `fx-tests summary` against this
 *     page across this change will see the CLI's number move.
 *
 *     Upstream divides by `totalTestRuns` (`old/index.html:480`) and that is right:
 *     `totalTestRuns += runCount` runs *before* the status dispatch
 *     (`fetch-test-data.js:2733`) and `SKIP` is one of the branches below it,
 *     so the skips are already inside it. The CLI's
 *     `totalTestRuns + skippedTestRuns` counted them twice. Measured, last 7
 *     dates:
 *
 *     | | page (unchanged) | CLI before | CLI now |
 *     | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | xpcshell | **4.72%** (743,332 / 15,739,304) | 4.51% (/ 16,482,636) | **4.72%** |
 *     | mochitest | **5.28%** (3,174,265 / 60,119,846) | 5.02% (/ 63,294,111) | **5.28%** |
 *
 *     The cell's second line already showed `skipped / totalTestRuns`, so it
 *     and the percentage were consistent all along.
 *
 *  3. **A short file now says how short.** The one place a *label* changed
 *     rather than a number.
 *
 *     `getRecentStats` narrows to `Math.min(days, dates.length)`
 *     (`old/index.html:445`) while the heading keeps saying "Summary (Last 7 Days)"
 *     (`:203`), so a file with 5 dates shows 5 days of data under a 7-day
 *     heading with nothing indicating it. The arithmetic is unchanged here; the
 *     heading is rewritten to `Summary (Last 5 Days)` when the window actually
 *     narrowed.
 *
 *     Not reachable on the pinned files — 199 and 198 dates — which is why it
 *     is covered by a test with a 3-date file rather than by the browser run.
 *
 *  4. **`markerCounts` is dropped from the merged file instead of being
 *     corrupted into 198 nulls.** A bug fix, in a field this page never reads.
 *
 *     `markerCounts` is an object of named series. Upstream's merge excludes
 *     only `metadata`, `dates` and `flavors` from its per-day array handling
 *     (`old/index.html:353-354`), so `markerCounts` is passed to `mergeArray` and
 *     indexed as if it were an array. Measured: the merged mochitest
 *     `markerCounts` is **an array of 198 `null`s**, having been an object of 5
 *     named series.
 *
 *     Invisible upstream because this page never reads it — `grep -c
 *     markerCounts index.html` is **0** — and the merged object is not stored
 *     anywhere the CLI can see. Fixed rather than reproduced because
 *     reproducing it means writing code whose only effect is to produce a
 *     wrong-shaped value; the merged result now omits the field, so a consumer
 *     asking for it gets `undefined` rather than 198 nulls that look like a
 *     real empty series.
 *
 *  5. **Each chart's `.info-text` now names the span it covers.** The fix for
 *     the three-windows problem, and the smallest one that works.
 *
 *     Upstream's four charts plot the entire file and say nothing about it,
 *     directly under a table headed "Last 7 Days". Each `.info-text` keeps its
 *     existing sentence and gains ` Covering 199 days, 2026-01-16 to
 *     2026-08-03.` — read off the data, so it cannot drift from what is
 *     plotted. Where the two harnesses differ the longer span is named with
 *     both, since one chart carries both series.
 *
 *     The markup is unchanged: the text is appended to the `<p>` that is
 *     already there.
 *
 *  6. **The two harness rows carry a prior-period comparison in their
 *     tooltip.** The one deliberate product change on this list.
 *
 *     `{harness}-stats.json` is the only file with real history — 199 dates for
 *     xpcshell — and the landing page showed one week of it against nothing.
 *     `lib/query/summary.ts` already computes the comparison for
 *     `fx-tests summary`, weekend-mix reasoning and all, so the page can have
 *     it for the cost of the call.
 *
 *     Each harness row's four cells keep their existing `title` sentence and
 *     gain a second line: `Job failure rate: 12.24%, prior 7d 7.54% (+4.70
 *     points).` The CLI's rate is quoted there, and since divergence 1 it is
 *     the **same** number as the cell above it — as are the other three. The
 *     line still names its metric, so the tooltip reads as a comparison of a
 *     named quantity rather than as a bare second percentage.
 *
 *     A change is reported only when the two *rendered* rates differ. The
 *     browser run caught the alternative: xpcshell's test failure rate went
 *     from 0.16540648605255448% to 0.17227572451742468%, which at two decimals
 *     printed `0.17%, prior 7d 0.17% (+0.01 points)` — every number correctly
 *     rounded, the line as a whole nonsense. It now reads `(unchanged at this
 *     precision)`. Measured: that fires on 1 of the 8 harness/metric pairs and
 *     the other 7 print a change, and `test/index-page.test.ts` asserts both
 *     branches so neither is left unexercised.
 *
 *     Flavor rows get no comparison: `computeSummary` reads a `StatsFile` and a
 *     flavor is not one — it has no `invalidJobs` and no `markerCounts` — and
 *     synthesizing one to get a per-flavor delta would be inventing a file
 *     shape to feed a query, which is how the CLI's numbers stopped matching
 *     the pages the first time.
 *
 *  7. **Inline handler attributes become `addEventListener`, and the two in the
 *     markup now throw once each.** The same arrangement `site/crashes.html`,
 *     `site/failures.html` and `site/errors.html` already ship, for the same
 *     reason: the markup is byte-identical, so `onclick="setDisplayMode(…)"` on
 *     the two toggle buttons (`old/index.html:192-193`) is still an attribute, and
 *     a module has no globals — so the attribute handler is a `ReferenceError`
 *     and the listener attached by this file does the work.
 *
 *     Measured in Chrome on the pinned snapshot: clicking Raw Counts logs
 *     exactly one `Uncaught ReferenceError: setDisplayMode is not defined` and
 *     the charts redraw in count mode. Listed rather than fixed because fixing
 *     it means editing the markup.
 *
 *     Every handler the page *generates* is gone: upstream's summary rows are
 *     built by concatenating HTML into `innerHTML` (`:483-514`, `:555`) and
 *     this file builds nodes, which answers the escaping question once. No
 *     `on*` attribute appears under `#statsSummary` on either page — upstream
 *     emits none there either, so this is a change of mechanism and not of DOM.
 *
 *  8. **`green.html#${kind}` still does not carry the dev parameters, and that
 *     is reproduced.** `old/index.html:487` wraps the issues link in
 *     `withDevParams()` and `:495` builds the green link without it, on the
 *     same row, two lines apart.
 *
 *     Checked rather than assumed to be an oversight: `green.html` does not
 *     load `fetch-utils.js` at all (`grep -c fetch-utils green.html` is **0**),
 *     so it has no `withDevParams`, reads no `?data-source=`, and fetches
 *     nothing that the parameter could redirect. Propagating the parameter
 *     would put a query string on a page that ignores it. Reproduced as-is.
 *
 *     The `#${kind}` fragment is `xpcshell` or `mochitest` — a bare fragment,
 *     unlike the issues link's `#date=21days`.
 *
 * ## What is *not* on the list, having been checked
 *
 * - **The `</h2>` typos at `:274` and `:276`.** Two `<h3>` elements are closed
 *   with `</h2>`. Parsed in jsdom to see what it actually costs: HTML5 error
 *   recovery closes the `h3` correctly, and
 *   `#xpcshellBreakdownContainer`'s children are `DIV H3 DIV H3 DIV` on both
 *   pages. So the markup is byte-identical, the parse is identical, and the
 *   only consequence is that the two are `h3` and the anchor handler selects
 *   `h2[id]` — so they are not click-to-anchor. That is a property of the
 *   *selector*, not of the typo: fixing the tags would not make them
 *   clickable. Left alone; the brief's "decide deliberately" is decided as
 *   "the markup is out of scope and the typo is inert".
 * - **`common-test-data.js`.** Not loaded, and was not before:
 *   `grep -c common-test-data index.html` is **0**.
 * - **URL state.** The page reads none — no `URLSearchParams`, no
 *   `location.hash` read anywhere in the file. It only *writes* a hash, on an
 *   `h2[id]` click (`:781-787`). Reproduced exactly: no read added, and adding
 *   one would be a new feature.
