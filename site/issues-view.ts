/**
 * The view model behind `site/issues.html`: what rows exist, in what order,
 * carrying which numbers. No DOM.
 *
 * The last and largest of the page migrations. The split follows the one the
 * four before it settled:
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/query/issues.ts` | the per-test counters and the component grouping, shared with the CLI | `test/query.test.ts` |
 * | this file | the page's view model — the row set, the sort, the search, the expansion, the URL state | `test/issues-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | `site/issues.ts` | the renderer and the interactions | `test/issues-page.test.ts` + the browser run |
 *
 * ## The shared drill-down was considered and **not** used
 *
 * `site/drilldown-view.ts` and `drilldown-render.ts` were extracted for
 * `crashes.html` and `failures.html`, and `site/errors.ts` already judged them
 * a poor fit for a third page. The same judgement is made here, and for a
 * sharper reason: the shapes disagree at every level.
 *
 * | | shared drill-down | this page |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | row unit | a group key — a signature or a message string | a **Bugzilla component** |
 * | what a row carries | `testCount` and `count` — two numbers | **seven** counters plus a derived rate |
 * | level 2 | directory path, collapsed away when it holds one test | **test**, and only those with `issueCount > 0` |
 * | level 3 | test | **issue message**, grouped by (type, text) |
 * | level 4 | occurrence | occurrence |
 * | the path-collapse rule | central to `expandGroup` | **absent** — there is no path level |
 * | sortable columns | 2 (`count`, `tests`) | **8**, each with its own default direction |
 * | what a filter changes | which rows are visible | the **numerator and denominator** of every number |
 *
 * Serving both from one module would mean widening `GroupRow` from two numbers
 * to nine, giving `SubRow` a fourth member with a different meaning of "test",
 * deleting the path-collapse rule behind a flag, and making the sort column set
 * a type parameter. That is the "three new booleans" signal several times over,
 * and it would put a `skipCount` on the crashes page's rows where it means
 * nothing.
 *
 * What **is** reused, because it genuinely is page-independent, is
 * `drilldown-render.ts`'s `el`, `externalLink`, `insertAfter`,
 * `removeFollowing`, `noData` and `searchBox` — the escaping question and the
 * search-box wiring answered once. See `site/issues.ts`.
 *
 * ## The Issue% denominator, measured
 *
 * `issues.html:944` carries its **own** `computeTestStats`, not the one in
 * `common-test-data.js` (which the page never loads — `grep -c
 * common-test-data issues.html` is 0). The fork differs in two ways that
 * matter: its `runCount` **excludes skips** (`:1060`, written as
 * `skip + timeout + fail + crash + pass - skip`), and it adds `issueCount` and
 * `issuePercentage`, which the shared version lacks.
 *
 * `lib/query/issues.ts` implements the same query for the CLI. **The two were
 * compared before either was reused**, per test and field by field, on real
 * data rather than on the fixture alone:
 *
 * | file | tests compared | mismatches |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `xpcshell-issues.json`, 21-day, full | 4,838 | **0** |
 * | `xpcshell-2026-08-04.json`, one day, full | 4,836 | **0** |
 * | `mochitest-issues.json`, 21-day, full | 21,016 | **0** |
 * | `test/fixtures/xpcshell-issues.json` | 10 | **0** |
 * | `test/fixtures/xpcshell-2026-08-03.json` | 11 | **0** |
 *
 * Compared: `runCount`, `skipCount`, `failCount`, `timeoutCount`,
 * `crashCount`, `issueCount`, and the rate itself. The component-level
 * grouping was compared the same way — 136 page components against the CLI's
 * `groupIssues`, every counter equal.
 *
 * The one field that differs is **`passCount`**, and it differs by exactly the
 * `EXPECTED-FAIL` count: the page folds `EXPECTED-FAIL` into `passCount`
 * (`:1056`, the final `else`), `lib/query/issues.ts` names it
 * `expectedFailCount` and keeps it out. **Both include it in `runCount`**, so
 * no displayed number moves — and `passCount` is accumulated
 * (`issues.html:2012`) but never rendered: there is no `generateStatItem` for
 * it anywhere in the page. Measured: 13 of 4,838 xpcshell tests and 7 of
 * 21,016 mochitest tests have a non-zero `EXPECTED-FAIL`, totalling 4,973 runs
 * on the xpcshell aggregate.
 *
 * So `lib/query/issues.ts` is used, unchanged, and this page adds no counting
 * of its own. **The denominator, stated explicitly as the brief requires:**
 *
 * > **Issue% = issueCount / (runCount + (skips enabled ? skipCount : 0))**,
 * > where `runCount` is pass + expected-fail + fail + timeout + crash — every
 * > run that reached a verdict, **excluding skips** — and `issueCount` is the
 * > sum of only the enabled types.
 *
 * Skips are added back to the denominator exactly when they are in the
 * numerator, which is what stops a skip from inflating the rate by being
 * counted above the line and missing below it. This is `issues.html:1078` and
 * `:2045-2048` and `lib/query/issues.ts:208`, which were verified to agree.
 *
 * ## This file must stay DOM-free
 *
 * `test/issues-view.test.ts` imports it, the root project compiles `test/**`,
 * and the root project has no DOM lib — so a `document` reach fails
 * `npm run typecheck` rather than being caught by review.

/**
 * Every component row for a file, under one filter setting and one search.

 * This is `renderComponentsView`'s two passes (`issues.html:1946-2029`) with
 * the rendering taken out. The order of operations is the part that matters and
 * it is upstream's:
 *
 * 1. **Every test is counted into its component's totals**, search or no search
 *    — `componentTotalTests` and `componentTotalTestsWithIssues` are built in a
 *    first pass over the *whole* file (`:1949-1965`), before the search is
 *    consulted.
 * 2. **The search then drops tests** (`:1979-1981`), and the surviving ones
 *    accumulate the row's seven counters (`:2007-2013`).
 * 3. **A test joins the expandable list only if `issueCount > 0`** (`:2016`),
 *    which happens *after* its runs have already gone into the denominator.
 *
 * Step 3 is the one that is easy to get wrong and the reason the CLI has a
 * `keepClean` option: a component's `runCount` includes the tests that never
 * failed, so its rate is over its whole population. Dropping the clean tests
 * first would inflate every rate — measured on WebExtensions :: General,
 * 6,087,719 runs instead of 6,131,520 (`lib/query/issues.ts:99-106`).
 *
 * A component with **no** test that has an issue is still a row (`:2111-2112`
 * renders it as `(N tests)` and `:2094` marks it `non-clickable`). The CLI
 * drops those (`lib/query/issues.ts:329`); measured on the pinned 21-day
 * xpcshell file there are exactly 3 — `Firefox :: Sharing` (5 tests),
 * `Core :: Widget: Cocoa` (1) and `Core :: Layout` (1) — out of 136. That is a

 * - **The denominator counts every status group**, `EXPECTED-FAIL` included

 * - **SKIP is in the denominator only for a SKIP line** (`:2540-2542`): a skip
 *   rate is over scheduled runs, every other rate is over runs that executed.
 *
 * ## The one divergence: all matching statuses, not the first
 *
 * Upstream resolves the issue type to **one** `targetStatusId` and `break`s out
 * of the search (`:2574-2590`), then counts only that group. With
 * `tables.statuses` ordered `… TIMEOUT-PARALLEL, FAIL-PARALLEL, … CRASH,
 * FAIL-SEQUENTIAL, TIMEOUT, FAIL, TIMEOUT-SEQUENTIAL`, that is `FAIL-PARALLEL`
 * for every FAIL line and `TIMEOUT-PARALLEL` for every TIMEOUT line — the runs
 * recorded under the other suffixes are dropped from the chart.
 *
 * **Measured on the pinned 21-day xpcshell aggregate**: 2,792 of the 3,788
 * tests with any failure have more than one `FAIL*` group, and 214 have more
 * than one `TIMEOUT*` group. A concrete case,
 * `toolkit/components/backgroundtasks/tests/xpcshell/test_backgroundtask_automaticrestart.js`
 * on `[test_backgroundtask_automatic_restart : 23] 0 == 3` — 48 runs under
 * `FAIL-PARALLEL` and 3 under `FAIL`, of which upstream charts 48.
 *
 * This is reproduced as a **fix**, not as a bug, because upstream contradicts
 * itself here rather than making a choice: the count rendered on the issue line
 * (`issueEntries`, from every `FAIL*` group) and the run list under it
 * (`getIssueRuns`, `:3168-3172`, which explicitly collects **all** `FAIL*`
 * status ids) both use the full set, and only the chart uses one. Reproducing
 * the chart's version would put a bar summing to 48 directly beneath a line
 * reading 51 and a list of 51 rows. Declared as divergence 8 in

 * `:3709-3712` falls through to `loadData()`, which reads the `date-select`'s
 * first option. The `isHistoricalMode = false` at `:666` is not the reason —
 * it describes the state before the first load — but the effect is that the
 * page opens on one day.
 *
 * The migrated page **defaults to the 21-day aggregate**, which is what
 * `fx-tests issues` already does and what `test/framing.test.ts` recorded as
 * the acceptance criterion for this migration. The rationale, from the owner:
 * *"I always use the issues page with #date=21days in the url"*, and 21 days
 * being the default *"would be an improvement"*.
 *
 * The two windows answer measurably different questions. On the pinned
 * xpcshell data: the 21-day file has **133 components** with an issue against
 * the single day's **87**, and while the top ten components are the same set,
 * the order differs — `Toolkit :: Add-ons Manager` is 6th over 21 days and 7th
 * on 2026-08-04, swapping with `Toolkit :: Crash Reporting`. A component that
 * had one bad night ranks high on a single day and is diluted 21-fold in the
 * aggregate, which is the case the change is for.
 *
 * `#date=<a day>` still selects that day, unchanged — see
 * `test/issues-page.test.ts`, which drives both.
