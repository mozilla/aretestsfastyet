/**
 * `errors.html`, migrated onto `lib/`.
 *
 * | file | contains | tested by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `lib/formats/errors.ts` | the file format, shared with the CLI | `test/formats.test.ts` |
 * | `lib/query/error-ranking.ts` | the CLI's ranking of the same data | `test/step5-query.test.ts` |
 * | `site/errors-view.ts` | this page's view model — grouping, sorting, filtering, expansion, URL state | `test/errors-view.test.ts`, no DOM |
 * | this file | the renderer, the virtualized list, and the interactions | `test/errors-parity.test.ts` + the browser run |
 *
 * ## The shared drill-down was considered and **not** used
 *
 * `site/drilldown-view.ts` / `drilldown-render.ts` were extracted for
 * `crashes.html` and `failures.html`. The judgement, with the table of shape
 * differences behind it, is at the top of `site/errors-view.ts`. In one line:
 * that drill-down is *key → dirPath → test → occurrence* with a fixed row unit,
 * fixed columns and a path-collapse rule, and this page is *group → sub → task*
 * where the row unit, the sub-row unit and the column set are all chosen by a
 * `<select>`. Serving both would have meant adding `msgCount`, `kindMask` and a
 * nullable key to `GroupRow`, two members to `SubRow`, and a synthetic
 * always-single `PathNode` level — the "three new booleans" signal, three times.
 *
 * What **is** reused, because it really is page-independent: `drilldown-render`'s
 * `el`, `externalLink`, `insertAfter`, `removeFollowing`, `noData` and
 * `searchBox`, and its `declare global` block describing the shared scripts.
 * That is a genuine saving — the escaping question, the CR-in-attribute
 * normalization and the `<tbody>` synthesis are all answered once, and all three
 * are things this page would otherwise have had to rediscover.
 *
 * ## What the migration removes
 *
 * **The string-concatenation renderer.** Upstream builds every row by
 * concatenating HTML and assigning `innerHTML`, which is what forces its
 * `escapeHtml`/`escapeAttr` calls and its `onclick=` attributes. Building nodes
 * answers escaping once, at `el()`.
 *
 * `common-test-data.js` is **not** loaded, and was not loaded before either:
 * `grep -c common-test-data errors.html` is **0**, and none of its seven globals
 * appears in the page. So the brief's requirement is satisfied with nothing
 * removed, and the page was loaded with the file absent from `dist-site/` to
 * confirm it — `tools/build-pages.ts` only copies the assets a page references,
 * and `ls dist-site/common-test-data.js` is a miss.
 *
 * The five shared scripts stay, loaded by name: `shared.js`, `fetch-utils.js`,
 * `dashboards.js`, `common-ui.js`, `common-links.js`.
 *
 * **The Chart.js CDN tag is gone**, and it is the one script tag this migration
 * drops. Upstream loads it (`old/errors.html:211`) for `createDayChart`
 * (`:975-1014`), its own bar chart — this page never loaded
 * `common-charts.js` or called `createRateChart`. That chart drew only in
 * 21-day mode, which is omitted (divergence 6), so the tag was a third-party
 * request for a library nothing could reach.
 *
 * ## Declared divergences from `errors.html`
 *
 * `PARITY.md` §4: byte-identical is the default and every exception is declared.
 * **This list is the whole set.** One enumerated list, no prose carrying an
 * extra entry.
 *
 *  1. **Inline handler attributes become `addEventListener`, and the two that
 *     are in the markup now throw once each.** The markup is byte-identical, so
 *     `onchange="onKindFilterChange()"` on the seven checkboxes and
 *     `onchange="onViewChange()"` on the `<select>` are still attributes — but a
 *     module has no globals, so the attribute handler is a `ReferenceError` and
 *     the listener attached by this file does the work. Measured in Chrome on
 *     the pinned snapshot: toggling one checkbox logs exactly one
 *     `Uncaught ReferenceError: onKindFilterChange is not defined` and the list
 *     re-filters correctly; changing the view logs one
 *     `onViewChange is not defined` and the view changes. This is the same
 *     arrangement `site/crashes.html` and `site/failures.html` already ship for
 *     their `onchange="loadSelectedDate()"`, and it is listed rather than fixed
 *     because fixing it means editing the markup, which the brief forbids.
 *
 *     Every handler this page *generates* — `onclick="sortBy('count')"` on each
 *     header, `onclick="event.stopPropagation();"` on each Searchfox and each
 *     occurrence link — is gone. Measured in Chrome by counting `on*`
 *     attributes in the live DOM under `#content`:
 *
 *     | state | old | new |
 *     | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | first paint, xpcshell 2026-08-04, message view | **47** | **0** |
 *     | first paint, mochitest 2026-08-03, message view | 37 | 0 |
 *     | either, in the test view (no per-row links) | 3 | 0 |
 *     | one mochitest test-view sub-row expanded (16,849 sub-rows) | **27,829** | **0** |
 *     | one mochitest component-view sub-row expanded (18,069 sub-rows) | 36,061 | 0 |
 *
 *     The message view's 47 is 3 sort buttons plus one `stopPropagation` per
 *     Searchfox link in the 50 rendered rows — 44 of the 50 rows carry a
 *     `file:line`. The number tracks what is on screen rather than the row
 *     count, because the list is virtualized.
 *
 *  2. **`data-group` is no longer an index into `currentResult.visible`.**
 *     Upstream writes `data-group="${idx}"` and the click handler does
 *     `currentResult.visible[+target.dataset.group]` (`:810`, `:1032`), so the
 *     attribute is a position in an array that is rebuilt by every filter, sort
 *     and view change. Here the row elements are held in a `WeakMap` to their
 *     rows, so there is no index to go stale. The attribute is still emitted,
 *     with the same value, because the virtualization reads it to know which
 *     chunk a row is in — but nothing resolves a row *through* it.
 *
 *     This is not a bug fix: upstream drops every expansion on re-render
 *     (`:713-715`), so the stale index is never read. It is listed because a DOM
 *     diff sees the attribute unchanged and a reader of the code sees a
 *     different mechanism.
 *
 *  3. **The total row's per-view "Tests"/"Messages" numbers are unchanged, and
 *     they are distinct counts, not sums of the column.** Worth stating because
 *     it is the *opposite* of `crashes.html` and `failures.html`, whose total
 *     rows overcount by summing each row's test count. This page's totals come
 *     from `seenTid`/`seenMid` — one flag per test and per message over the
 *     whole pass — so they are exact. Measured on the pinned xpcshell
 *     2026-08-04 file, message view, all kinds on: **the Total row shows 624
 *     tests where the rows' test counts sum to 7,519**, a 12.0× difference, and
 *     624 really is the number of distinct test IDs in the file. Nothing changed
 *     here; it is on the list so a reviewer comparing the three migrated
 *     drill-down pages does not read the difference as a regression in the
 *     other direction.
 *
 *  4. **The percentage tooltips still ignore the search term — reproduced, not
 *     fixed.** `pctTitle(count, currentResult.total)` divides by the grand
 *     total, and `currentResult.total` is only ever recomputed by a re-group or
 *     by the message view's kind-toggle path (`:686-695`). A search re-picks
 *     which rows are visible and touches no number.
 *
 *     **Measured in Chrome on the old page, pinned xpcshell 2026-08-04, message
 *     view, search `NS_ENSURE_TRUE`:**
 *
 *     | | value |
 *     | --- | --- |
 *     | rows matching | 100 of 1,078 |
 *     | their occurrences | 20,922 of 315,376 |
 *     | Total row, before the search | `624` / `315 376` |
 *     | Total row, **during** the search | `624` / `315 376` — unchanged |
 *     | top row | `NS_ENSURE_TRUE(mNameHashtable.Get(aName, &index)) failed`, 15,281 |
 *     | its tooltip | **`4.85% of all occurrences`** |
 *     | 15,281 / 20,922, the share of what is on screen | 73.04% |
 *
 *     So the top row of a searched list reads 4.85% while being nearly
 *     three-quarters of everything the reader can see, and the Total above it
 *     is fifteen times the sum of the visible column.
 *
 *     **Why reproduced rather than fixed**, deliberately: the tooltip says
 *     *"of all occurrences"*, and that is the question it answers correctly —
 *     "this message is 4.85% of everything xpcshell logged today" is a useful
 *     and true statement, and arguably the more useful of the two. Changing the
 *     denominator to the filtered total would make the *wording* false unless
 *     the wording changed too, and rewording a tooltip a human reads is a
 *     product decision rather than a migration's to make. The Total row has the
 *     same property and is visibly not the sum of the column under it, which is
 *     the honest signal that these numbers are file-scoped. Filed here rather
 *     than fixed silently; the fix is one argument at the two `pctTitle` call
 *     sites in `render`/`renderSubRow` plus a string change, and it should be
 *     made on both pages at once or neither.
 *
 *  5. **A message with a line and no file still renders without either.**
 *     `groupName` nests the line inside the file (`:493-494`), so a message the
 *     grouping distinguished *by line* is displayed by its text alone.
 *     Measured: **16 of the 1,078 messageIds** on the pinned xpcshell
 *     2026-08-04 file have a line and no file. Reproduced, because changing it
 *     changes the row label a reader compares against the old page. Note the
 *     sort by name is affected too: two such rows sort as equal.
 *
 *  6. **The "Show Last 21 Days" and "Load task details" buttons are deliberately
 *     omitted, because the data they ask for does not exist.** This is the one
 *     entry on this list that is an *intentional departure from the markup*
 *     rather than a difference in how the same markup is driven, and `PARITY.md`
 *     §4 requires it be declared with its reason. It is stated here and nowhere
 *     else.
 *
 *     Upstream has both buttons at `old/errors.html:173-174`. `initHistoricalToggle`
 *     fetches `{harness}-errors.json` (`:1190`) and `loadTaskDetails` fetches
 *     `{harness}-errors-with-taskids.json` (`:1098`).
 *
 *     **Measured against the published artifacts on 2026-08-05, over the
 *     Taskcluster index the page's own `fetchData` resolves
 *     (`test-info-{harness}-timings`):**
 *
 *     | file | xpcshell | mochitest |
 *     | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | `{harness}-errors.json` | **404** | **404** |
 *     | `{harness}-errors-with-taskids.json` | **404** | **404** |
 *     | `{harness}-2026-08-04-errors.json` | 200 | 200 |
 *
 *     And over every one of the 21 dates `index.json` offers, fetching each
 *     daily errors file and reading its `markers`: **6 of 21 exist per harness,
 *     and `hasDays` is false on all 6 while `hasTasks` is true on all 6.** So
 *     neither aggregate shape is reachable from either harness, by either page.
 *
 *     **What the old page does when the button is clicked**: `common-ui.js:234`
 *     throws on the non-ok response, and its `catch` writes
 *     `Historical data not available` into `#content` and sets the status text
 *     to `Error loading data` — so the control's only effect is to replace the
 *     list with an error. The "Load task details" button is never even shown:
 *     its display is driven by `hasTasks` being false (`:1198`), and `hasTasks`
 *     is true on every file that loads.
 *
 *     **Why omitted rather than reproduced.** Emitting a control that cannot
 *     work satisfies a DOM diff and turns a known gap into a hidden one — the
 *     mistake `try.html` made with its Reproduce button. A reader cannot tell a
 *     button that is broken from one that is waiting for data. Removing it says
 *     what is true: this page shows one day, and there is no aggregate to show.
 *
 *     **What went with them**, all of it reachable only from these two buttons:
 *     `isHistoricalMode`, the `initHistoricalToggle` call and its
 *     `onHistoricalToggled` callback, `loadTaskDetails`, the per-day chart
 *     (`createDayChart`, `:975-1014`) with its `historical-chart` wrapper, the
 *     Chart.js CDN tag that existed only to draw it, and `__view`'s `historical`
 *     field. `#date=21days` in a bookmarked URL is handled rather than dropped
 *     — see `loadFromUrlHash`.
 *
 *     **What stayed, because it serves the live page**: `hasDays` and
 *     `numDays` in `site/errors-view.ts` are file-shape probes, and `hasDays`
 *     still picks which of two sources a task's date comes from in
 *     `instancesOf`. `buildDetail` still computes `dayCounts`, which is `null`
 *     on every file above. `isHistoricalDate` stayed and gained a second caller
 *     — it is now what recognizes a stale `#date=21days`.
 *
 *  7. **A job name the file cannot resolve renders as empty, not `"undefined"`.**
 *     Same class as `crashes.html`'s entry 6. Upstream indexes
 *     `tables.jobNames[taskInfo.jobNameIds[id]]` with no guard. Not reachable on
 *     the pinned files — every task index resolves — so this differs only in a
 *     branch neither page takes.
 *
 *  8. **A tooltip whose message contains an HTML entity now shows the message,
 *     not the decoded entity — and this fixes a live defect.** Found by the
 *     browser diff rather than by reading, which is why it is worth stating how.
 *
 *     `escapeAttr` (`common-ui.js:14`) escapes `"` and `'` and **not `&`**.
 *     Upstream writes `title="${escapeAttr(text)}"` into a string and lets the
 *     HTML parser build the attribute, so a message whose text literally
 *     contains `&nbsp;` arrives in the parser as an entity reference and is
 *     **decoded**: the old page's tooltip shows a non-breaking space where the
 *     message says `&nbsp;`. Probed in Chrome to be sure of the mechanism rather
 *     than inferring it:
 *
 *     ```
 *     innerHTML, & unescaped   ->  "a b"   (decoded; what the old page does)
 *     innerHTML, & escaped     ->  "a&nbsp;b"   (what escapeAttr does NOT do)
 *     element.title = raw      ->  "a&nbsp;b"   (what this page does)
 *     ```
 *
 *     **Measured on the pinned files**, counting message texts containing a
 *     parsable entity reference: **13 of 35,474 mochitest rows (1,586
 *     occurrences of 67,840,668), and 0 of 1,078 xpcshell rows.** So it is live
 *     on mochitest and unreachable on xpcshell. The concrete row is a
 *     `NS_ENSURE_TRUE(entry && …) failed` warning quoting editor content
 *     `#text("&nbsp;X")`, where the old page's tooltip silently turns the
 *     literal source text into whitespace — losing exactly the detail a reader
 *     hovering a truncated message is looking for.
 *
 *     Fixed rather than reproduced, because reproducing it would mean
 *     re-introducing an entity-decoding round-trip on purpose, and because the
 *     new page cannot easily reproduce it: `el()` assigns the property. The
 *     browser harness normalizes it so the rest of the `title` comparison still
 *     runs. Note the *rendered row text* is unaffected on both pages — upstream
 *     uses `escapeHtml` there, which does escape `&` — so only the tooltip
 *     differs.
 *
 *  9. **The message view's row unit drops the component, and every row now
 *     carries a component summary.** The one entry on this list that is a
 *     **deliberate product change** rather than a migration decision — the rest
 *     describe how the same behaviour is reached; this one changes what the
 *     page shows, on purpose.
 *
 *     Upstream's row is one **`messageId`**, which the format defines as a
 *     distinct (kind, text, file, line, **component**) tuple. But the component
 *     is not a property of the message: the message is emitted at a `file:line`,
 *     and the component is whichever test happened to be running when it
 *     printed. Keying on it splits one message into several rows for a reason
 *     that says nothing about the message — and the page already has a separate
 *     component view for the component question.
 *
 *     **Measured on the pinned xpcshell 2026-08-04 file:**
 *
 *     | | old | new |
 *     | --- | --- | --- |
 *     | message-view rows | **1,078** | **870** |
 *     | rows for `TargetingContextRecorder: Could not get "addonsInfo"` | 9, of 30,856 / 232 / 140 / 12 / 10 / 9 / 7 / 3 / 2 | **1, of 31,271** |
 *     | rows for `uncaught exception: Object` at that location | 61 | **1, of 3,437** |
 *
 *     36 keys hold more than one messageId, and **0 of the 36** differ by
 *     anything other than the component — so the merge loses nothing but the
 *     split. Occurrences are conserved exactly: both groupings sum to 315,376.
 *
 *     What replaces the split is a **component summary on the row**, in the
 *     component column upstream already had. One component reads as itself; a
 *     row where one component holds a strict majority reads
 *     `Firefox :: Nimbus Desktop Client  +8 more`; a row where none does reads
 *     `61 components` and names nobody. The `title` carries the full breakdown,
 *     biggest first, capped at twelve with a line saying how many components
 *     and how many occurrences were dropped. The threshold and the cap are
 *     documented with the distributions they came from in
 *     `lib/query/error-ranking.ts`, which is where the rule lives so that
 *     `fx-tests errors` shows the same words on the same row.
 *
 *     The other two views are untouched: the test view still groups by test
 *     path and the component view still groups by component, and
 *     `test/errors-parity.test.ts` asserts both against `--group-by test` and
 *     `--group-by component`.
 *
 * Two things worth naming that are **not** divergences, both measured rather
 * than assumed:
 *
 * - **The status line still reads `N test jobs · 0 markers`.**
 *   `old/errors.html:1076` reads `meta.markerCount`, and the published files carry
 *   `markerCounts` (a per-kind object) and no `markerCount`. So `(undefined ||
 *   0).toLocaleString()` is `"0"` on both pages: the pinned xpcshell 2026-08-04
 *   file shows `1,301 test jobs · 0 markers` where the file holds 315,376
 *   markers. Reproduced exactly — fixing it would change a number on screen,
 *   and it is a defect in the page rather than in the migration. It is not on
 *   the divergence list because both pages print the same wrong string.
 * - **The virtualized list.** Kept, including its 50-row chunks, its 600px
 *   observer margin, its measured row height and its pinned chunk. It is not
 *   decoration: the pinned mochitest 2026-08-03 file produces **31,530
 *   message-view rows**, and the list is what keeps the DOM small — measured at
 *   first paint on the *xpcshell* 2026-08-04 page (870 rows), **529 elements
 *   under `#content` for the 50 rows actually rendered**. Both pages render the
 *   same 50, which is why every `renderedRows` in the browser comparison reads
 *   50 rather than the row count.
 *
 * Everything else — the `message` default view, the count-descending default
 * sort re-asserted on every view change, the `ascending = column === 'name'`
 * rule, the seven checkboxes and their view-dependent meaning, the double-click
 * solo, the single-day default window, the absence of any run-count
 * normalization, and the `#date&q&view&hide` state including `q` clearing the
 * box — is reproduced.
