# Are Tests Fast Yet?

Dashboards, and a command-line tool, for inspecting the health and performance
of Firefox's automated tests, built from data generated in Firefox CI.

Live site: <https://tests.firefox.dev/>, where the data is refreshed every
night. There is also a staging instance at
<https://fqueze.github.io/aretestsfastyet/> used to develop the dashboards
themselves; its data is regenerated whenever work-in-progress patches to the
data generator are pushed to Try.

## Install the `fx-tests` CLI

```sh
npm install -g github:mozilla/aretestsfastyet
fx-tests guide          # start here: what the data can and cannot tell you
```

Requires Node ≥ 20. That is the whole install — it builds on install, and there
is no npm package to publish or registry to configure. To update, run the same
command again.

```sh
fx-tests test netwerk/test/unit/test_bug1195415.js   # one test's history
fx-tests try <revision>                              # triage a Try push
fx-tests issues                                      # worst components, ranked
fx-tests --help                                      # all 13 commands
```

> **Early preview.** The CLI is new and still finding its edges; several
> defects have been found by running it rather than by its tests. Please report
> anything that looks wrong. The dashboards are unaffected by it.

## Dashboards

Every page is listed on [`help.html`](help.html); the most useful ones are
also reachable from the "Dashboards ▾" menu in the top-right corner of each
page. The filenames below are the URLs on the site; where a page's source lives
in the repository is described under [How it works](#how-it-works). The main
ones:

- **Test Health** (`index.html`) — the landing page. Trend charts and a 7-day
  summary of flaky test-failure, flaky job-failure, skip and invalid-job rates
  for XPCShell and Mochitest.
- **Test Issues** (`issues.html`) — every non-passing test outcome (failures,
  timeouts, crashes, skips) over the last 21 days, grouped by Bugzilla
  component and by directory tree. The best place to start triaging
  intermittents.
- **Test Info** (`test.html`) — a deep dive on a single test
  (`?test=path/to/test`): failure/skip/crash history, per-run timings, and a
  pass/fail breakdown across job configurations.
- **Try Push Results** (`try.html`) — aggregates the failed tests from a single
  Try push, perma-fails first, matched against historical data.
- **Failures** (`failures.html`) / **Crashes** (`crashes.html`) — failures
  grouped by message, and crashes grouped by signature.
- **Test Timings** (`xpcshell-timings.html`) — per-test run times with a tree
  view and scatter charts.
- **Build Times** (`builds.html`), **Mochitest Jobs** (`mochitest-jobs.html`),
  **XPCShell Jobs** (`xpcshell-jobs.html`), **Manifest Runtimes**
  (`manifests.html`), **Worker Pools** (`workers.html`) — job- and
  infrastructure-level timing views.

A number of older or more specialized dashboards (Perma-Fails, Variant Impact,
Errors & Warnings, Resource Usage, and others) are listed under "Less
frequently used dashboards" on `help.html`.

## Performance Tests data

`performance-tests.html` shows performance jobs by worker pool, with runtime,
activity and regression bug resolutions. Its TypeScript sources are in
`site/performance*.ts`; build and serve it using the dashboard instructions below.

Task timings come from the same Firefox CI worker artifacts as `workers.html`.
The browser retains three processed days in memory and up to seven in IndexedDB.
Cache keys include the artifact URL and date, so a new producer run invalidates
old data. Storage failures fall back to downloading; the first visit to an
uncached day still downloads the full worker artifact.

Bug data comes from one cached [STMO query, 129802](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/129802).
It parses regression tables using the Performance Regression Tracker’s rules
and runs daily at **05:00 UTC**, refreshing three inputs synchronously:

- [129799](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/129799) fetches public
  `perf-alert` bugs created in the last 365 days, including descriptions and
  resolutions, through a single server-side Bugzilla request.
- [129801](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/129801) reads original
  alert-summary membership and recent job labels directly from Treeherder PostgreSQL.
- [129837](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/129837) fetches the tracker's
  current job-label cache from GitHub. The final query decodes the GitHub content
  response, prefers those mappings (including explicitly unresolved signatures),
  and uses database labels for new signatures. There is no embedded snapshot.

Only the final query needs a schedule: its `query_` dependencies execute afresh,
with description parsing included in the final query. If an input fails, publication
fails and STMO retains the previous successful result. The dashboard rejects
results older than 48 hours and displays “—”; hover explains the failure.
Inspect query 129802's execution history in STMO to diagnose refresh failures.
The browser never calls the Treeherder or Bugzilla APIs, and no GitHub Action
refreshes this data. STMO still uses Bugzilla's API server-side because the
available BigQuery tables do not contain bug descriptions.

Only bugs with parsed regression tables qualify. Truncated tables expand using
original regression alerts; reassigned alerts cannot qualify an improvement-only
bug. Group totals deduplicate bug IDs, and resolution links open just that
category's bugs. The rolling year follows the bug-data refresh, independently of
the selected worker day. Attribution follows the tracker's published label cache;
unknown labels cannot be assigned to a dashboard row.

## How it works

The site is a set of static HTML pages with inline CSS and JavaScript, sharing
a few scripts (`fetch-utils.js`, `shared.js`, `common-ui.js`, `dashboards.js`,
…). Each page fetches pre-aggregated JSON data from the Firefox CI (Taskcluster)
index at runtime — there is no server. The data is produced by
[`fetch-test-data.js`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/timings/fetch-test-data.js)
in mozilla-central, which queries Firefox CI and writes the compact,
table-encoded JSON files the dashboards consume.

The repository holds the pages in three places:

- **the root** — the 17 pages that have not been migrated, plus `docs.html`.
  **These have no build step**: they are served exactly as they appear in the
  tree, and editing a page and reloading it is the whole loop.
- **[`site/`](site/)** — the 9 pages that have been migrated onto the shared
  library in `lib/`, so that they can `import` typed and tested code instead of
  carrying another copy of it inline. `npm run pages` builds them into
  self-contained HTML in `dist-site/` (gitignored), one file per page with its
  script inlined. That is the only thing the build buys, and it touches nothing
  in the root — see the header comment in
  [`tools/build-pages.ts`](tools/build-pages.ts) for why the output is a single
  file. Unlike a root page, a page in `site/` cannot be opened straight from
  the tree: its entry point is a `.ts` file, which a server labels
  `video/mp2t`, so the browser refuses the module outright. Editing one means
  re-running `npm run pages` and loading the built copy from `dist-site/`.
- **`old/`** — the 9 superseded root pages the migrated ones replace, kept for
  comparison until the new ones have been trusted.

The command-line tool below shares that toolchain — TypeScript, a bundler and a
test suite — across `cli/`, `lib/`, `test/` and `tools/`. See
[`docs/PARITY.md`](docs/PARITY.md) for why the pages are being migrated onto
the shared library and how the two versions are compared, and
[`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) for how the built pages are meant to ship.

## `fx-tests`, the command-line tool

`fx-tests` answers the same questions as the dashboards in plain text, for
people and agents working in a terminal rather than a browser. It reads exactly
the same published JSON files, through a shared, typed and tested library in
`lib/` — there is no second data path and no server.

See the top of this file to install it. To work on it from a checkout instead:

```sh
npm install
./bin/fx-tests guide                       # runs the TypeScript sources directly
```

Node ≥ 20 is required, for built-in `fetch`; `.node-version` pins the major
version for `fnm`. `./bin/fx-tests` needs no build step. `npm run bundle`
produces `dist/fx-tests.js`, the bundle the `bin` entry in `package.json` points
at; unlike `bin/`, it is committed, because an installed package cannot build
itself — Node refuses to strip types under `node_modules`. Re-run it and commit
the result whenever the sources change; `npm test` fails on a stale bundle.
There is deliberately no `build` script: pacote prepares a git dependency
whenever the manifest has one, and that preparation breaks `npm install -g`
from a git URL. `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` are the other two gates.

**`fx-tests guide` is the intended entry point.** It prints what each command
answers, which file family it reads, and — the reason it exists — the traps in
this data that are not discoverable from `--help`: that the errors files exist
for only a few of the published dates, that a manifest with all-zero durations
was skipped rather than instant, that a test's overall failure rate hides a
single-config perma-fail. Its factual claims are covered by tests, so it fails
the suite rather than going quietly stale.

[`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md) is the full command reference and
[`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) describes how the library was extracted.
[`docs.html`](docs.html) renders every markdown doc in this repository in the
browser, with the links between them resolved.

## Data format

The JSON file formats are documented in
[`JSON_FORMAT.md`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/timings/JSON_FORMAT.md),
which lives next to the generator in mozilla-central, and in
[`lib/formats/FORMATS.md`](lib/formats/FORMATS.md) in this repository.

The two differ in kind. `JSON_FORMAT.md` describes what the generator was
written to emit; `FORMATS.md` records what the index was actually serving, from
validating every file the index publishes. It lags less, and where the two
disagree it is the one to trust — it exists because several documented claims
turned out not to hold.
