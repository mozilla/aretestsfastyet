//   - The top-right hover menu, injected on every Tier-1 page that loads this

//   - help.html, the full listing page (renderDashboardList).
//   - The compact teaser section at the top of index.html (renderDashboardTeaser).

// To add/rename/reorder a dashboard, edit the DASHBOARDS array below; every
// consumer updates automatically. `tier: 1` entries appear in the hover menu and
// at the top of help.html; `tier: 2` entries only appear (collapsed) on help.html.
// `featured: true` entries appear in the index.html teaser.

// `desc` is the short one-liner used in the hover menu tooltip and the index
// teaser chips. `long` is the fuller description shown on help.html — detailed
// enough that a reader can decide whether the dashboard is worth exploring.
